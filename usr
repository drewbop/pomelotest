Go Smart Contracts Development Kit</p><p>Go is a powerful and very developer-friendly programming language that is popular among backend developers. Thanks to its developer-friendly, developers can write code more efficiently and productively. I announced the support of writing smart contracts in Go in Pomelo Season 1. Since Pomelo Season 1, a lot of progress has been made. In Pomelo Season 3, I&#39;m excited to announce the support of source-level debugging and source coverage analysis in Go smart contracts</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/uuosio/gscdk/blob/main/images/debugging.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debugging Go Smart Contracts</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/uuosio/gscdk/blob/main/images/code-coverage.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Coverage Analysis</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/uuosio/gscdk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Code</a></p><p><br></p><p>2.

"description": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We are building a platform that will allow anyone with an EOS account to participate in the ownership of physical solar power generation facilities. By decentralizing the ownership of these clean, renewable power generation facilities, we help to enable the financing needed to build MORE renewable power generation. Our project will contribute to a cleaner, greener and safer planet for all.</p><p><br></p><p>The funds will be used to develop the UI / frontend and EOS wallet integration with an existing backend service that facilitates the tokenizing of assets. This work product will be open sourced when complete, so any other EOS project that is attempting to tokenize physical assets in this manner can bring their product to market with less friction and more rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>Our current estimate for development of our MVP is: $250 to $300K. We are investing $100K of our own funds, so therefore would need another $150 to $200K of SEED financing.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>EnergEOS™</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Energy powers our modern society, and renewable, sustainable energy production is one of the key growth industries worldwide for the next several decades.</p><p><br></p><p>Team EnergEOS™ was formed to expand the development and adoption of the EOSIO platform in the renewable energy and sustainable transport industries. The impressive scalability, transaction speed, very low power consumption and support for ultra-high-volume IoT transactions make EOS ideally suited to provide the next generation of blockchain infrastructure for these markets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Energy DeFi</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our first product is a regulatory-compliant tokenized financing platform for solar power facilities. This platform will effectively replace traditional financing models to streamline and reduce the friction in finding multi-tenant financing solutions for Solar facilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Investors of any size will now be able to easily begin, expand, and/or diversify their sustainable portfolio by owning a stake in consistently yielding renewable power generation facilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Solar power plant owners, with minimal fees and fast placements, will be able to recapitalize or deleverage to support expansion or other business needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Our product suite will:</p><p>• Facilitate the tokenization, sale, and subsequent ownership of Industrial scale Solar Facilities.</p><p>• Provide asset owners a portal to initiate and execute a compliant tokenization of their Solar asset(s).</p><p>• Allow any investor to acquire and trade ownership of the tokenized assets.</p><p>• Track and display the performance and generated revenue by the tokenized assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EOS Mainnet Integration</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Since Energy markets are highly regulated in most countries of the World, our platform will also have to be regulatory compliant. Therefore, all sensitive energy production &amp; consumption data will be stored on a private blockchain under KYC / AML guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p>However, we will be providing two growth aspects for the EOS public chain:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1)</strong> All solar industry professionals, and prospective investors on our platform will have to sign up using an EOS account.

"summary": "The EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard is a technical and operational standard for building the underlying value of the digital metaverse and spiritual home from the bottom up through NFT.",
"description": "<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><p>·EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard is a technical document that builds the underlying value standard of NFT in Metaverse.</p><p>·Open source, provide detailed instructions for use, and continue to iterate.</p><p>·EOS community users can enter without barriers and can directly generate economic benefits.</p><p>·The standard will be promoted in the EOS community to help the EOS ecosystem to become more prosperous.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the value standard of EOS Metaverse NFT?</strong></p><p>Like mountains, deserts, grasslands, and cultivated land in the real world, although they all exist on the surface, their value is different for humans. This is especially true in the world of the metaverse. Anyone can write a string of code and claim that it is the soil that breeds the various ecology of the metaverse, but whether this soil has value or not, the digital economy bred by this soil Whether the carrier is valuable or not needs to be measured by an open, more efficient, and easier to reach consensus standard. The EOS Metaverse NFT value standard is to construct a technical standard for the underlying value of a digital metaverse and spiritual home.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Features of EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inclusiveness</strong></p><p>EOS has the genes to become the greatest public chain and has a very high inclusive value. Based on this NFT value standard, anyone in the world can obtain NFT at almost zero cost and no threshold, and enter the metaverse blockchain. The world, this will doom the infinite development attributes of NFT, as long as they are citizens of the earth, they will have the opportunity to permanently obtain their own private NFT assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>At present, most of the current metaverse NFTs, after the initial release, their attributes and values show a difference in attribute levels. This is very unfair to users who obtain NFTs at the same time or users who obtain NFTs later. It does not reflect the principle of fairness in EOS ecological value. So based on the Metaverse NFT value standard, the initially issued NFT is a valueless NFT. It requires users to invest, produce and create to dig out value. The value elements and value potential of each NFT will be the same in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Investment</strong></p><p>The NFT in Metaverse can only exert its value under economic activities. Since economic activities are involved, there will inevitably be investment activities. In the Metaverse NFT value standard, the Swap impermanent slippage mechanism, stable fund pool, and basic investment compensation guarantee mechanism will help investors share or reduce investment risks according to contract algorithms and standards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Productive</strong></p><p>NFT in the metaverse has the attributes of value development and production activities. NFT development and production activities mainly rely on the user&#39;s time and spiritual contribution in the metaverse world. In the Metaverse NFT value standard, the value of the user&#39;s time and the value of production activities will be defined, and from the mechanism, the user&#39;s labor efforts and rewards in the Metaverse will be fully guaranteed, and one labor will be rewarded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shareability</strong></p><p>NFTs in the Metaverse need to have the attributes of shared value. The Metaverse ecology is a co-construction and shared ecology, and the shared value of NFTs should not be controlled by market capital, but generated through a consensus algorithm mechanism. Users&#39; time and labor efforts in the Metaverse will help to enhance the shared value of NFTs, in which capital does not play a decisive role, and NFTs or holding groups with higher shared values will surely obtain more lasting and higher returns. .<strong>Liquidity</strong></p><p>The circulation of economic value of Metaverse is a very important link, and it is the fundamental guarantee that economic activities can continue to be active. The Metaverse NFT value standard sets out the attributes of NFT transfer and transaction. At the same time, it also has the standard for optional asset package transfer. The owner can choose to package any digital assets together to participate for liquied.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>scalability</strong></p><p>In addition to expanding its own ecological application scenarios, the development of the Metaverse NFT ecosystem is mainly to expand the creation of other more valuable NFTs. With this basic Metaverse NFT standard, the ecosystem will be open to attract more Metaverse application scenarios. Enter the metaverse world with more valuable NFTs and share the future economic value of NFTs.</p><p>With the establishment of such a NFT value standard, the EOS public chain has the lowest threshold and the highest efficiency. Low threshold and high efficiency are the most basic conditions for attracting the participation of hundreds of millions of grassroots civilians. From the perspective of the performance of the public chain, with the characteristics of high TPS, low transaction fees, and instant transactions, EOS is more suitable for the development of the metaverse ecology and is more suitable for the operation of the metaverse digital economy than ETH and other public chains. It is said that EOS will be the most suitable soil and environment for the development of the metaverse ecology, and only the EOS public chain can meet the promotion and implementation of the metaverse NFT value standard.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What did we do</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Work completed in the first fundraising stage:</p><p>1. For the first time in the EOS ecosystem, we put forward the standard concept of the private domain of the metaverse, so that everyone in the world can completely independently own a piece of private land that truly belongs to themselves in the metaverse.</p><p>2. Established and improved the algorithmic stability mechanism of SWAP transactions, completed the development of the Swap contract, optimized the defects of the existing algorithmic stability model in the market by improving the mechanism, and helped by algorithmic mechanisms such as irregular slippage, stable pool, and bonus pool. Investors share or reduce investment risks and minimize the impact of capital affecting market prices in a relatively concentrated time period.</p><p>3. Completed the contract development of NFT farms and distributed NFT mining, and established the world&#39;s first distributed NFT mining standard model. Each mining pool differentiates the APY rate of return of the mining pool according to the size of its NFT shared value . Through the algorithm mechanism of NFT shared value, more users and players can be shared, so that players and users who provide more shared value to the community can obtain more lasting and higher returns, while forcing players with poor consensus. And users turn to a virtuous economic cycle on the road.</p><p>4. Completed the development of the first trading market for packaging NFT assets on the EOS test chain. This is a brand new attempt to integrate NFT and digital assets and participate in the transaction process.</p><p>5. The first swap contract developed according to the NFT value standard has been open sourced. The swap contract code has been submitted to BEOSIN for audit in mid-March 2022, and the audit report is expected to be completed by the end of March.</p><p><br></p><p>Work completed in the second fundraising stage:</p><p>1. The swap smart contract we developed according to the NFT value standard has passed the audit of BEOSIN on March 24, 2022. The address of the audit report:</p><p>https://beosin.com/hermit/back/website/common/preview/single? fileUuid=e677f8826eec4bec2f3673885519d143oeNbkZtek9D&amp;reportNum=202203241332</p><p>2. We launched the first decentralized NFT value standard private domain portal community website in the EOS ecosystem. All EOS ecosystem users can freely participate in the content construction of the community private domain portal, revision of NFT value standards, participation in public discussions and discussions in the community. </p><p>3. We completed the development of the first version of the NFT distributed shared farm in May 2022. After more than a month of data testing on the EOS main chain, the trial operation was officially opened on July 13, 2022, and it has initially formed The market atmosphere of differentiated APY yield farms. Through the data of the core contract of the project on EOS Authority, the overall market user activity and quality have achieved preliminary results.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/21fddefd-df58-448f-8816-1e9067e7d4df.png\"></p><p>EOS Authority contract query: https://eosauthority.com/account/ylecorecodes?network=eos</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Future Outlook</strong></p><p>1. According to the concept of creating a private domain of the Metaverse, in addition to starting to open source the relevant contract codes involved in this standard step by step, we also plan to start a standard plan for the complete decentralization of the NFT project, using a “Decentralized domain name &amp; Decentralized project + Decentralized storage ” model to makes it convenient for any user in the world to quickly and easily build their own decentralized private domain platform, and truly realize the decentralization of projects.</p><p>2. In the 2nd-3rd quarter of 2022, we will continue and improve NFT cultivation and production standards, distributed NFT mining standards and packaging NFT transaction standards, and open source code, and the related contract code will also further complete the audit-related work;</p><p>3. Based on the NFT value standard, we will further integrate the CryptoTree NFT developed by our team (a Dapp that has been running on the TRON public chain in September 2019, and has been selected into the top three encrypted collections in the world on Dappradar and Dapp.com) Category DAPP) projects are migrated to the EOS ecosystem and serve as an application demonstration of the Metaverse NFT value standard.</p><p>4. Continue to unite all EOS community developers and users to jointly maintain and upgrade the metaverse NFT value standard, making it a real universal standard in the EOS ecosystem as soon as possible.</p>",

For example, check out this thread which has nearly 100,000 impressions: https://twitter.com/Trim_Bot/status/1503526698914037763?s=20&amp;t=P_jB3OjRv5SOtHDFj_oV5g</p><p><br></p><p>All funds donated will be used to either promote popular EOS tweets or to finance contests/giveaways that can generate buzz for EOS.</p><p><br></p><p>There are so many promising catalysts on the way to EOS - now is the perfect time to generate hype.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My goal is to continue promoting the narrative that EOS will be the comeback coin of 2022, with the specific focus of reaching investors currently outside of the EOS community to increase the number of new entrants.

Moreover, giveaways/contests can be leveraged to expose more people to the EOS ecosystem and generate more momentum. As an example, there could be an “EVM MEME CONTEST” where the winner gets $500 in EOS, that coincides with the debut of EVM to create an organic hype machine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community Involvement is Key</strong></p><p>Many of your may know me from the EOS telegram groups in which I am active.

"description": "<h1>Background</h1><p><br></p><p>My name is Andrew. I have been playing drums for 23 years, touring the west coast of the United States with my little indie band Tan Sister Radio, touring the whole US with math-pop-punk band Weatherbox, other tours and shows and recording sessions with bands like Monarch, Ocelot, and around a dozen others. I have also been a music entrepreneur for over a decade, first starting a record label with magic hinged laser-cut record packaging, then opening a time-share recording studio. I have worn many hats in the music industry, from artist to sound engineer to merchandiser to music instructor.</p><p><br></p><p>My organization, Ursa Polaris Records, has served the San Diego music community for over 8 years, as a record label and a recording studio. Meanwhile, our north star has been to replace the top-down music industry with a bottom-up, grassroots music industry. </p><p><br></p><p>I come at this goal from a place of despair. The music industry is an institution protected from disruption through copyright. And the institution as it has been architected, on top of concepts from the sheet music days, is broken. And this is a microcosm of the larger picture.</p><p><br></p><p>Our institutions are failing the people they&#39;re supposed to represent. But I&#39;ve seen how distributed consensus can empower a united group to create more capable and resilient institutions from scratch. Around 2017, I was inspired by Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and other grassroots free-market challenges to the status quo that reward people directly for the work they do in the system. In light of this inspiration, I began to re-craft a visualized music encyclopedia I had been designing as a hobby project. I wanted to take what I thought was a super cool way to browse music and turn it into an entirely self-consistent system that solves the major outstanding issue with the music industry, which is control of PR and sales channels, along with the difficulty of getting someone, anyone, to listen to your music.</p><p><br></p><p>As a user-curated visual encyclopedia of music, I could just copy the basic idea of Everipedia. But what I really want to demonstrate is how to re-shape an entire industry with a system that incentivizes creating valuable things by evenhandedly rewarding each increment of value in the product flow, from producer to consumer.</p><p><br></p><h1>Public Good</h1><p><br></p><p>With that as background, the public goods of this project are as follows:</p><ol><li>Provide a free-to-use, open-access encyclopedia of music, visualized in a graph of musicians connected by collaboration. Users curate the encyclopedia in exchange for tokens, which they can use to promote their favorite musicians or collaborations. There will be <strong>NO token sale </strong>and tokens can only be earned from work, like subjective proof-of-work.* (see endnote for token emission outline)</li><li>Use the verified data in the encyclopedia to retroactively reward the people who made the music, and continue rewarding music-makers as they continue to create.</li><li>Provide an open-source example of both the visualized encyclopedia (which could be easily re-used to represent actors in films, guests on podcasts, pro wrestlers, etc.) and the incentivized system that attempts to mathematically represent where value is created within the industry.</li></ol><p>I personally see the incentivized system as the truly universal public good of this project. Every industry is bound to have some sort of skewed incentive structure that reduces renumeration for the true value creators in the industry. I don&#39;t know any of these industries as well as the music industry, so I&#39;m not the right person to try to define the value creation dynamics of other industries. But for each industry, there&#39;s someone out there who knows it like the back of their hand, and I hope that this project&#39;s insights and challenges can serve as a guide for others looking to use blockchain to mathematically encapsulate the dynamics of a complex system into internally consistent incentive structures.</p><p><br></p><p>The music industry is just one of many parallel systems our civilization uses to organize itself. Seeing the holes in the system, there is a temptation to burn it all down, but such attitudes lead all to ruin. The way to make change is to make people want it, not to force it upon them. By creating self-sustaining economic experiments and testing them against other options in the marketplace, for each industry someone will eventually touch upon a correct answer to the question of: &#34;Where is value created within this system?&#34; My hope is that communicating the value creation of the industry I know will inspire others to create their own answer to this question for whatever they&#39;re passionate about.</p><p><br></p><h5><strong>*</strong>The formula that controls the diminishing inflation mechanism is based on two formulas combined together. The first, t(ln t) , is based on Metcalfe’s law, which measures the value of a social network. The second, 1/t^2, comes from the inverse square law, which governs the propagation of all things through spacetime, from light, to gravity, to sound itself.</h5><h5><br></h5><h5>This formula produces a token distribution curve that looks like this:</h5><h5><br></h5><h5><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rLF1RVwxY48kEcAZh7BSMYUPmTtL1EHVJcATqWjNTY1V1dU03pwRmrBdi-RGGhSN8kJ_SGSbDuuVxiYJ7wPj2BHHbDlJnSHJtsC0n2dFKl92oEut5WRpFcBBGG1y0aMJICo-hEBw\" height=\"211\" width=\"394\"></h5><h5><br></h5><h5>The maximum supply is:</h5><h5>@10^9=214.728006592</h5><h5>@10^100=8,140.45936536</h5><h5>As such, it may be necessary to multiply token rewards by a large number, perhaps 10^6.</h5><h5><br></h5><h5>For tokens awarded to musicians and other music-makers, in order to incentivize consistent collaboration, their token reward can be run through an alternate formula:</h5><h5>g = the number of prior collaborations with the group</h5><h5>t = the number of prior projects total in the history of music</h5><h5>X = the number of tokens awarded for a given project submission</h5><h5><br></h5><h5>X = g² × [㏑(t)]/t</h5><p><br></p><h1>Past Seasons</h1><p><br></p><p>Thanks to the generous contributions of Pomelo, an ENF direct grant, and most importantly our individual contributors, Polaris was granted a total of more than 1400 EOS through Pomelo to date. Because this is not enough to get any specific action item done, none of these funds have been spent.</p><p><br></p><p>I am working on this project in off hours without taking any distribution from Pomelo funding, which remains for a time when funding can be used more effectively, such as in Pomelo Bounties.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a proposal for developing this as an open source project, and reaching out to anybody who would like to help make it. A more comprehensive description of this grant, as well as architecture and pseudocode, is located at https://github.com/UrsaPolarisRecords/Polaris/blob/main/PomeloGrant.md .</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1>In-Depth Description</h1><p><br></p><h2>The Problem:</h2><p><br></p><p>Finding and discovering music is difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem of distribution is largely solved by solutions like Spotify and Emanate. But promotion through advertising and radio is still a captured system, and is controlled by the major label gatekeepers.</p><p><br></p><p>In the 1990s, the legacy label system took 93% of musicians’ revenue. Now, the legacy label system takes only 88% of musicians’ revenue. The system could still use some improvement.</p><p><br></p><h2>The Solution:</h2><p><br></p><p>Organize music by the relationships between the people who create the music. Our solution uses an interactive data visualization called a Hypertree (courtesy of Xerox PARC lab), to create a data map of the connections between musicians. Like this:</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uS0JcDo63_0jMffsRgmHy7zCENdLKr4ElJVYzZ928VvGPjEjY-e3vXaGg3Jba_TvO4l0dXyM6Rq7N2da-I03uLdUfz5fFXLX3YhENxNNP8FH_DONw9d2oODFHs9NamZONtU2IHpQ\" height=\"526\" width=\"556\"></p><p><br></p><p>This system’s data source is fed when users upload and curate information, in exchange for tokens. All token awards are run through a diminishing inflation function, ln(x)/x, where x is the transaction counter.*</p><p> </p><p>The tokens are used in a lottery to determine the center point of the visualization, each time the page reloads, based on the number of tokens users stake to each artist. </p><p><br></p><p>This creates a mechanism for users, as well as artists themselves, to advertise their music using the tokens.</p><p><br></p><h2>Milestones:</h2><p><br></p><p>This project currently has a tentative architecture and basic pseudo-code. We are open to any developers who are excited by this project, or anybody who thinks they can add value to the project and would like to join the team. </p><p><br></p><p>The languages involved in the designed architecture are: </p><p>-Javascript</p><p>-Neo4j (Graph DB with SQL-ish query language, <a href=\"https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/</a> )</p><h3>UPDATE:</h3><p><strong>we are considering either openCypher (based on Neo4j) or the as-yet-unreleased GQL (Graph Query Language) instead of the Neo4j implementation</strong></p><p>-C++ for a relatively simple EOS smart contract</p><p>-Javascript Infovis Toolkit/JIT (d3-like data visualization library, <a href=\"https://philogb.github.io/jit/demos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://philogb.github.io/jit/demos.html</a> )</p><p><br></p><p>We’ve identified a few tasks working toward an MVP, along with an estimated cost of each.

"description": "<h2>NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA)</h2><h3> </h3><h2>Introduction:</h2><h3>Hello everyone, my name is Shu Fan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT\" rel=\"nofollow\">an original NFT artist</a>. I have <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">published works</a> on EOS for more than a year, and I am also a <a href=\"https://genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org/members/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">member of Eden on EOS</a>. I plan to combine my creative experience and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCptl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden Capital</a>&#39;s expertise to jointly launch the NFT standard for traditional painting artworks on EOS in my name. Different from other NFTs, traditional painting works of art have their own unique characteristics, and it is necessary to establish exclusive NFT standards to better display their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>In the last season, this project received 35 donations totaling 49 EOS and the corresponding Pomelo funding match. We would like to express our gratitude to the EOS community. In recent months after Season 2, we have made many explorations on the development and cooperative application of NFT standards for traditional painting artworks. Finally, based on the characteristics of EOS and the <a href=\"https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract/wiki/Structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT standards of Atomichub</a>, we have explored a relatively simple and feasible traditional painting method. The NFT standard has been publicly published on Medium, &#34;<a href=\"https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works on EOS blockchain</a>&#34;(NS-TPA).</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The first application demonstration work - <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/template/shufan.free/6787\" rel=\"nofollow\">Found a treasure on the way home</a>, was also published using this standard, and appropriate promotion was carried out. I will publish more traditional art works based on this standard, and will continue to maintain, optimize and promote this standard on EOS. Hope you all continue to support, thank you!</h3><p><br></p><h2>Details:</h2><h3><strong>1. The changes that NFT brings to traditional painting artists.</strong> NFT, giving traditional painting artists a new platform for displaying and sharing their works, is also an epoch-making revolution for the future traditional painting art market. I am excited to be in such an era. Since I <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/asset/2199023263895\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold my first work</a> on eos.atomichub.io on April 8, 2021, <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/profile/shufan.free#sellHistory\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 160 works have been sold</a> in total, sales increased by more than 100 works compared with the previous season. The originals of each work are hand-painted originals with heart, including procreate originals , Paper hand-painted original. Let me feel the value transfer charm that NFT brings to works of art.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>2. Early explorers of NFTs in traditional painting and art works.</strong> From the market point of view, there are currently only 93 NFT collections on <a href=\"eos.atomichub.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">eos.atomichub.io</a>, but the vast majority of them are Gamefi; and my 4 collections are the rare ones, which are based on traditional paintings art works. Therefore, from this point of view, I could be regarded as one of the early explorers and leaders in the transformation and extension of traditional painting art works in the direction of NFT. At the same time, the experience of the past one year has also made me feel that the current NFT standards and forms have many restrictions on traditional painting works of art.</h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSBZ8sF3gx6NZcZ9fgqkyHHR8mVBmejixDkGpdot8xLTo\"></h3><h4>ShuFan&#39;s 4 collections</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>3. Traditional paintings and artworks have their own characteristics.</strong> The Gamefi NFT standard that is dominant in the existing market is not very suitable for traditional painting art NFTs, because Gamefi&#39;s NFTs generally have the characteristics of unlimited or huge Mints, strong correlation between NFTs, and relatively low creation costs. It highlights the playability value of the game. Traditional painting art works NFTs are different , under normal circumstances, it has a small circulation (even only 1 Mint), high originality requirements, relatively independent between NFT, relatively high creation cost, and paper-based physical manuscripts can be mailed to collectors It highlights the viewing value, scarcity and collection value of art works, and has a higher demand for protection of brands, art copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Therefore, there should be a set of NFT standards that are more specific to traditional painting works of art to better demonstrate their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>4. The market potential of traditional painting art works is huge.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-expensive-artworks-sold-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">most expensive work</a> of art worth over $100 million in 2021, at $103,410,000, is Picasso&#39;s Femme assise près d&#39;une fenêtre (1932); moreover, according to <a href=\"https://www.masterworks.io/?utm_source=google+sem&amp;utm_medium=platform&amp;utm_campaign=art_invest-in-art_canada&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5-WRBhCKARIsAAId9Fm5DMVPE3LER8tN7d_dFjEVPKyFIXwoSdOjXEV8-nqnwDbepQDk2KcaAp0AEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" rel=\"nofollow\">the masterworks report</a>, In 2020, the global painting transaction value has exceeded 50 billion US dollars, the transaction volume has exceeded 30 million, and the market potential is huge. With the empowerment of NFT, the market potential of traditional paintings and artworks will be further stimulated.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaYBTAaw4AuMum5wzfMCzeAYfp7DMEW7Ep2sw9GfMswg3\"></h3><h4>Global Painting Market Value and Transaction Volume 2009-2020</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>5. EOS needs a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting art works.</strong> EOS is a well-known public chain whose ecology is re-prospering. Its excellent blockchain design (fast speed, low transaction cost, customized account names, etc.) is very suitable for the development of NFT. However, on Atomichub, compared to <a href=\"https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">WAX</a>, the issuance, trading volume, and trading value of the <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT market on EOS</a> can only be considered as an early stage. However, it is foreseeable that in the near future, more traditional painting works of art will be transformed into NFTs. It is necessary and urgent to establish a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting and art works in EOS to carry this huge potential market.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>6. The funds raised will be used for:</strong></h3><h3>1. Support to update this standard to be more beautified, complete, and easier to use for users.</h3><h3>2. Cooperate with existing NFT platforms, art galleries, to attract more artists to adopt this standard.</h3><h3>3. Promote the NFT standard of traditional painting artworks. If we get enough grants, we&#39;ll create a new independent website focusing on NFT of traditional paintings and invite artists to join, etc.</h3>",

Even for experienced users, managing resources remains tedious and cumbersome.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p><ul><li>We believe building an open-source solution to automatically manage CPU and NET would greatly increase the user experience of the EOS Network, help lessen barriers to entry, and increase network activity overall.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution - ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>Stake ECPU to receive automated CPU + Net Powerups Daily. Stake can be delegated to multiple users.</li><li>ECPU can be thought of as a CPU equity which represents ownership in a permanently locked pool of EOS, where returns are paid in the form of CPU and NET daily.</li><li>ECPU allows a one-time setup solution to CPU and NET. It will allow dApps to delegate CPU and NET to users for a daily allotment that requires zero effort for recipients, and minimal effort for dApps. The EOS pool will also be locked out of circulation, and will continue to grow with mining, REX appreciation, and excess voting rewards. ECPU will add deflationary pressure to the supply of EOS, which in turn will benefit all EOS holders.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Users</strong></p><ul><li>DApps managing resources on behalf of users</li><li>Users of DApps that do not pay for resources</li><li>Users onboarding friends and acquaintances </li><li>Power Users</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><ul><li>The smart-contract will hold a pool of EOS staked to REX with voting assigned to Reward Proxies.</li><li>Income from Reward Proxies will be utilized for automated CPU+NET powerups for all stakers of ECPU.</li><li>Token distribution will be credibly neutral, difficulty-adjusted mining, where contributing small amounts of EOS to the smart-contract pool will reward ECPU tokens. No developer allocation, pre-mine, or benefit to insiders whatsoever. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><ul><li>ENF Recognition Grant recipient SOV Labs LLC has experience creating dApps including SOVDEX(https://sovdex.io/ https://soveos.github.io/SOVDEX/), BTCMiner (www.btcminer.one ), SAFE (https://soveos.github.io/safefrontend/), and XSOV (https://soveos.github.io/xsov.app/).  </li><li>SOV Labs LLC also has previously utilized difficulty-adjusted mining to power automated payout and buyback systems (please see sovdexpaydiv and sovconverter contracts) and has created a token (SVX) with the ability to delegate its utility to other users.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Finances</strong></p><ul><li>Grant funds will be used to fund the initial smart-contract EOS pool (which will be locked out of circulation), as well as fund development of the open-source smart-contract, and open-source application front-end. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Success will be measured with the following deliverables:</strong></p><ul><li>Releasing working dApp with open-source smart-contract and open-source front-end code that fulfills design requirements (see slide).</li><li>Deploying a working initial instance of the open-source code.</li><li>Locking the Keys of the contract to 15/21 BP permission / locking the EOS Pool out of circulation.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Design Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Users staking ECPU must be able to receive daily pro-rata allotments of CPU + Net Resources without needing to sign any transactions. </li><li>Users must be able to delegate staked ECPU to multiple accounts from a single account.</li><li>ECPU must be a transferable token with credibly neutral mining system defined as: no team supply, no pre-mine, and difficulty adjusted by mining activity.</li><li>The EOS Pool must not be able to be withdrawn or be reduced, and must be locked out of circulation.</li><li>Waste Reduction method- example solution.. powerups will be delivered pro rata to stakers in according to total ecpu supply. Income not used is for powerups is added to REX. Inactive staked accounts reduced or eliminated daily powerup distribution until action pushed, etc..</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Timeline</strong></p><ul><li>11/2021 receive funding</li><li>3/2022 release open-source smart-contract code</li><li>4/2022 release open-source front-end code</li><li>5/2022 launch code with Pomelo funded EOS pool </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Current Alternate Solutions:</strong></p><ul><li>EOSPowerUp.io allows users to deposit EOS and receive daily powerups by subtracting from users balances daily and subtracting a fee upon transaction. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>ECPU Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li>ECPU does not require users to top up/continually pay, will take no fees for development team, and has a method to reduce waste. ECPU is a superior solution as it allows dApps to manage their ECPU delegated stake for their users, abstracting away CPU and NET costs completely for users. Unstaked ECPU is also liquid and transferable, allowing the owner to earn from providing liquidity, exchange for other tokens, and send to other accounts at their convenience.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why You Should Help Fund ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>ECPU will help create a better User Experience while adding flexibility and options for all EOS users. </li><li>ECPU will also put deflationary pressure on the EOS supply benefiting all EOS holders.</li><li>ECPU will have a fair distribution that will allow anyone to have liquid and transferable equity in a compounding pool of EOS.</li><li>ECPU contract and application code open-source and an asset to the community.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you for supporting EOS through Pomelo and reading our proposal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

"description": "<h2><strong>What is a Swarm?</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><em>A Swarm involves two parts:\t</em></p><p><br></p><p>1. <strong>Respond</strong>: In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387999/\" rel=\"nofollow\">neutral</a> way, adhering to the principle of stoicism. It limits FUD by denying aggressors the emotional response they seek. It’s generated with AI + human validator.</p><p><br></p><p>2. <strong>Amplify</strong>: The neutral response by coordinating a large network of gig workers called “bees” to engage by liking, sharing and commenting. Coordination is incentivized through crypto micro-payments. </p><p><br></p><p><em>Swarms apply to two scenarios:</em></p><p><br></p><p>1. <strong>Individual: </strong>Addresses one aggressor at a time. One comment is used to reply to the negative content. That comment then gets Swarmed with ten or more supporting comments.</p><p><br></p><p>2. <strong>Group</strong>: Aggressors coordinate negative replies to one post. The original post is Swarmed with ten or more supporting comments. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Swarm Selection</strong></h2><p>The first post to apply to a scenario above will drive the selection of the first Swarm raised, and so on. The Bee Team will monitor posts that may apply. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optional</strong>: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/rdf7KpWeDW\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alert us</a> if you see a post that applies. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Group Example</strong></h2><p><em>Before the Swarm, the only two visible comments are negative. After the Swarm, the bees’ comments out-ranked the negative ones. To further ensure the bees&#39; comments out-rank, we have the ability to perform a Mini Swarm (10-20 like/RT) on a few of the comments.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>﻿</em><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/1d90fe89-d826-4e0e-9d87-3214eefeeb85.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Swarm limited the damage from the reality that EOS price depreciation = FUD.</strong></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Individual Example</strong></h2><p><em>Here is a large crypto influencer who is insulting EOS. </em></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/003e1735-b70c-4503-9ac7-0e8089372c79.png\" width=\"631\"></p><p><br></p><p>The response:</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/2a9a97c6-95a3-4e46-bb63-1872e46abc5e.png\" width=\"396\"></p><p><br></p><p><em>The EOS influencer replies in a neutral and respectful way.

It happened the </em><strong><em>shortly after</em></strong><em> original negative Tweet, and referenced the post from our Swarm.</em></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Historical Examples</strong></h2><p>The examples below show that there can be tangible losses due to FUD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>80%</strong>: &#34;Pink slime,&#34; a troll term for &#34;lean finely textured beef,&#34; was spread throughout social media. It was inaccurately deemed unsafe, causing Beef Products Inc to lose “80 percent of its revenue, the closure of three of its four plants and hundreds of people losing their jobs.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>$1.4B</strong>: The infamous United Airlines and Passenger Removal in 2017 resulted in a negative firestorm of social media content. Their stock suffered a loss of over one billion dollars in value, even though the airline was in its legal right to remove the passenger. </p><p><br></p><p>*<em>Sourced from </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Jaw-Manifesto-Defending-Reputations/dp/1455582972\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Glass Jaw</em></a><em>: A Manifesto for Defending Fragile Reputations in an Age of Instant Scandal</em></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Swarm Cost</strong></h2><p>The cost will adhere to the closest arrangement of Swarms in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YukdC3zqFxViLw4JLGMGOnmNOkVFzE0axQEmOrM_fXU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOS Bees bulk pricing calculator </a>from the total amount raised. For example, in Pomelo Season 6, $580 was raised. The closest arrangement was 300 Bee / 10 comments (x1) and 400 Bee / 10 comments (x2) for a total of 3 Swarms. </p><p><br></p><p>With your donation, we are also building the ability to expand beyond Twitter/X. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>EOS Bees is asking the EOS community to take the time to internalize the effects of FUD. Even our better intentioned tendency to create drama contributes to price depreciation. The EOS brand needs the insurance from FUD that Swarms bring. </p><p><br></p><h3><strong>We kindly encourage you to contribute to this essential initiative now!</strong></h3>",

"description": "<p>Project URL:</p><p><a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grant/edit/eospapa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">eospapa.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Background of the project:</p><p><br></p><p> EOS is a new generation of blockchain. The blockchain has certain thresholds from account creation to use. The creation of this project is for public welfare. The original intention is:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Help new users get the first human-readable 12-digit EOS account at low cost and convenience without relying on third-party help. And provide a one-click convenient resource replenishment button to replenish resources to the account，and this service is not-for-profit.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Help new users understand the EOS blockchain, and help new users learn and how to use the EOS blockchain and EOS DAPP. Community mutual assistance, non-profit, anyone can join and understand EOS, without any threshold and exclusivity.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Give airdrop rewards to volunteers in the community who are willing to help others understand and use the EOS blockchain and help others create accounts. Airdrops are available to every participant and without exclusivity.</p><p><br></p><p>4. There is a correlation between account creation in the EOS system, and it is difficult to protect the privacy of a new account. The project implements the method of using a centralized exchange to withdraw coins to create an account to protect the privacy of a new account. Anyone who owns EOS on the exchanges can use it without exclusivity.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Project usage:</p><p><br></p><p>1. EOSPAPA is a public service for the EOS community, helping newcomers to understand EOS and create EOS accounts. Self-service account creation using smart contracts. The create cost is only 0.06EOS (This fee is charged by the EOS system to buy RAM, and the developer doesn&#39;t profit), and the airdrop reward makes the create cost close to 0 or even negative. The smart contract code and script code are completely open sourced on github, and anyone can use and set up such public services for free.</p><p><br></p><p>2.Provides a simple one-click function of rushing into system resources, and a simple one-click purchase of RAM resources. This function is mainly for wallet users of the scatter protocol and is completely free to use.</p><p><br></p><p>3.Solved the community&#39;s complaints that EOS account creation is difficult and expensive, and the service is non-subsidized, decentralized, automatically implemented by EOS smart contracts, and will not touch the user&#39;s private key during the create process. Any user who has entered the community can use this service for free, and any member who has already entered the community can use this service for free to help others create EOS accounts.</p><p><br></p><p>4.Give volunteers who help and serve the community airdrop rewards to promote the development of the EOS community. Anyone can register as a volunteer on the smart contract. There is no exclusivity to become a volunteer, anyone can join.</p><p><br></p><p>Project Progress:</p><p><br></p><p>1. The project has been online for 6 months and has helped new users in the EOS community create more than 3000 EOS accounts. Our new goal is to add 1,000 new users to the EOS community every month, help 1,000 new users understand and use EOS, and have an independent EOS account controlled by the private key.</p><p><br></p><p>2.The volunteer function has been online for 3 months, and 25 people have been registered as volunteers on the smart contract, helping more people to enter the EOS community. Volunteers are continuing to be recruited. Our goal is to develop 100 volunteers each quarter. Each volunteer helps 10 to 50 new users.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Continuously promote the commercialization of the use of EOS, and continue to promote the use of the EOS blockchain to traditional business channels, so that the market realizes the value of the EOS blockchain. Develop the community and lay the foundation for the commercialization of the EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>development route:</p><p><br></p><p>1 Decentralized self-service use of smart contracts to deploy token smart contracts with one click. （completed）</p><p><br></p><p>2 The token icon is saved on the chain, and an on-chain token icon protocol is created. （smart contract completed）</p><p><br></p><p>3 One-click upload of the NFT avatar corresponding to the account, and the NFT avatar is also saved on the chain.（smart contract completed）</p><p><br></p><p>4 Privacy creation of account, confusing the relationship between the funds source and the generated account, to achieve the function of protecting privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>5 EOS Volunteer Interactive Platform.</p><p><br></p><p>6 EOS Frequently Asked Questions FAQ. （completed）</p><p><br></p><p>7 Intelligent One click powerup. Automatically analyze the resources that each account may need, and automatically select a different optimal dosage amount for each powerup.</p><p><br></p><p>8 eospapa use instructional video production.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>https://t.me/eospapa_bot</p><p><br></p><p>Robots are free for anyone to use, there is no exclusivity, and they are public goods</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/63a56f83-332d-459b-b491-71b4dce2c407.jpeg\" width=\"309\"><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/1f85c2d8-5208-41c7-8afc-9b4539d329d5.jpeg\" width=\"308\"></p>",

"description": "<h1><strong>First Free &amp; Arabic Course in Fractal Governance based on More Equal Animals Book &amp; EdenOS Solution</strong></h1><p><br></p><h2><strong>Pitching </strong></h2><p><br></p><p>I am proposing to extend my work after the successful translation of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@fadialshalabi/review-of-the-arabic-translation-of-more-equal-animals-the-subtle-art-of-true-democracy-86250357a33e\" rel=\"nofollow\">More Equal Animals Book into Arabic</a>, and move it forward into the first free Arabic Course.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will be free open source under the creative commons license and will move the book from elite reading to a large scale.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Most projects involving teamwork as well as most ideas of organizing local communities fail when attempts are made to build a successful governance model. In most cases, the matter turns directly to building alliances inside the group in one way or another and giving a particular lobby all the power regarding decision-making, which will then take the group in the direction it wants.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in the game of free democratic elections, influencers collect votes from those who are not interested in the election process. By doing so, they can achieve a simple majority of 51%, which allows them to be declared legitimate representatives of society.</p><p><br></p><p>In his book titled &#34; <a href=\"https://falkvinge.net/files/2013/04/Swarmwise-2013-by-Rick-Falkvinge-v1.1-2013Sep01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swarmwise</a>: The Tactical Manual to Changing the World,” <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Falkvinge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Falkvinge</a> talks about the Heisenberg metrics phenomenon and its impact on various organizations. The idea is summarized by the fact that individuals intend to act dishonestly in order to support their win. A typical example of Heisenberg metrics in practice is what happened with the site mp3.com. This site was a pioneer in the music cloud business in 2011 when they offered what is called a pay-for-play service. This is a service in which an artist would get a piece of the site’s revenue, which was distributed amongst all of the artists on mp3.com in accordance with how much their songs were played on the site. The result was that everybody wanted to financially support their favorite artists. To do so, they set up all the computers they could access to play music from said artist on the site, but with the volume turned off as to not disturb anybody. Some people coded bots that would repeatedly stream an artist’s music to boost artificial numbers, which of course translated into money. Heisenberg metrics unfortunately also happen at the political level, and when people rig this, their candidate has to win.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time candidates focus on the process of winning elections for team or group governance, and the goal of winning is quite different from actually representing the real team. This is especially true with the current political games such as political advocacy campaigns, defamation of politicians, politics of focusing on identity and excluding others, the manipulation of votes and of the delimitation of electoral districts, and television debates. With all this in mind, one cannot be sure that this leads to fair representation for all in governance.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>The course</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>The course will contain video lectures and support material in Arabic explaining the book, and EdenOS work in fractal democratic governance process for blockchain-powered communities.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will cover of course basics of blockchain and EOSIO</p><p><br></p><p>The course will be a free and public good and the first-ever idea in Arabic. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://violet.garden/post/My-introduction-of-The-Arabic-Translation-of-More-Equal-Animals-Book-5253\" rel=\"nofollow\">My introduction of The Arabic Translation of More Equal Animals Book</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fadialshalabi/review-of-the-arabic-translation-of-more-equal-animals-the-subtle-art-of-true-democracy-86250357a33e\" rel=\"nofollow\">Review of the Arabic translation of “More Equal Animals: the Subtle Art of True Democracy”</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://payhip.com/b/iDOGr\" rel=\"nofollow\">More Equal Animals Arabic translation</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

"description": "<p><strong>People from 22 countries already used passports on Pomelo! Improve your </strong><a href=\"https://pomelo.io/user/lukapercic?tab=trust\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Pomelo Trust Bonus here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Port cryptographically proves your uniqueness to the global community (1 person 1 EOS account) and dwarfs Sybil attacks. It only exposes the country of origin and no other personal data. It’s an ambitious and unique effort to onboard massive Public Key Infrastructure provided by<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zv5mwSSgNY\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ICAO and Passports</a> to EOS blockchain. Port allows you to tap your passport on your phone and join the global trust-chain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does an end-user need to do?</strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/nf_njp-Qx2U\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong> Watch Android demo</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><ul><li>Use the app to scan the QR code from the service integrating Port (e.g. Pomelo)</li><li>Enter specific passport data into the app to establish secure communication with the passport (that data stays locally)</li><li>Tap the passport on the back of the phone to read it</li><li>Review and approve the request to send passport attestation (cryptographic) data to the Port smart contract.</li></ul><p>That’s it, your EOS account is now attested as unique!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is happening behind the curtain?</strong></p><p>When all required data is entered into the Port app (i.e. EOS account name &amp; passport specific) secure connection is established between the app and a passport. App then sends a hash of EOS account name + EOS blockchain data to the passport for signing. Passport returns the signature and its trust-chain authentication data.</p><p>This data is sent to the Port server (later smart-contract) for authenticity verification. When verification succeeds contract stores all relevant passport attestation data which can be used by on-chain (smart contracts) &amp; off-chain third parties for account uniqueness check and other purposes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why this ID solution? Why not some other identity?</strong></p><p>Typical DID solutions out there require trusted third parties to bring DIDs on the chain. This takes the form of a person looking at your ID documents, then sign using their key that they have seen the documents. We skip the manual labor, personal data collection, storage, and trust required, for a more secure, cheaper (no real cost per person), more private, and much faster and decentralized solution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public good</strong></p><p>All components of the solution will be fully open-sourced, and documentation provided for people to deploy. We are also running instances so dapps can use it as “lego” and instead focus on other parts of their dapp.</p><p><br></p><p>Port can be used as an infrastructure piece to ensure Sybil protection on-chain in d/apps;</p><p>⮞ for voting/election</p><p>⮞ quadratic funding (Pomelo Trust score)</p><p>⮞ UBI airdrops for humanitarian or marketing campaigns</p><p>⮞ Building block for more anonymous verifications</p><p>⮞ limit orders (e.g. one order per person)</p><p><br></p><p>We keep maintaining a ton of open-source code;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apps:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/flutter-port-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">flutter-port-app</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/flutter-port-sdk\" rel=\"nofollow\">flutter-port-sdk</a></li></ul><p><strong>Web components:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/browser-link-for-port-apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">browser-link</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-link-for-port-apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">npjm package</a></li></ul><p><strong>Server + verification logic:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/port-py-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">port-py-server</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/dmrtd\" rel=\"nofollow\">dmrtd</a></li></ul><p><strong>We also provided a default implementation </strong></p><p>Website <a href=\"https://port.link/\" rel=\"nofollow\">port.link</a> for easier onboarding to the app stores: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/si/app/port-link/id1596748294\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Store</a></li><li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.zeropass.port\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play Store</a></li></ul><p>...and Pomelo integrated Port as an additional trust score provider.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This Season goals are:</strong></p><ol><li>Managing Port service for the Pomelo, providing customer service, solving bugs, and expanding support for whatever passport variants we find out floating in the wild.

We want to spread ideas of how our global society can better organize itself in a decentralized manner for the benefit of all. We intend to do this by building a comprehensive training/education portal that will be free to use and will cover the following general topics:</p><ul><li><strong>Fractal Democracy</strong> <em>(i.e. “True Democracy” via Eden on EOS as outlined in Daniel Larimer’s book More Equal Animals)</em></li><li><strong>Holacracy</strong> <em>(removing the need for hierarchical control structures of traditional organizations)</em></li><li><strong>Decentralized Blockchain Technology </strong><em>(promoting censorship resistance and a society with equal access to products and services via blockchain)</em></li></ul><p> </p><p>The target markets for the various training materials will be:</p><ul><li>Local Communities</li><li>Grades 3-8</li><li>Grades 9-12</li><li>Post-Secondary School</li><li>Homeschooling Households</li></ul><p> </p><h2><strong>Use of Funds</strong></h2><p>All funds raised thus far have been accumulating in the EOS account <a href=\"https://www.bloks.io/account/antifragiled\" rel=\"nofollow\">antifragiled</a>.

The only problem back then is that NFTs were not a thing, so despite all the popularity thrust upon the artists, we never really got paid.</p><p><br></p><p>Then 8 months ago my half brother Nathan Rempel brought me into the WAX NFT scene. Life for me has never been the same.</p><p><br></p><p>WAX NFTs allowed me to do what I always wanted to do as an artist. Interact with my fans and give them artwork prizes, presents, gifts and whatever. Giving away NFTs and making super easy fun games out of my artwork is a dream come true.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out what my team of volunteer developers are building with me on WAX - <a href=\"http://www.myzicklearmy.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.myzicklearmy.io</a></p><p>I couldn&#39;t do this without them, and they&#39;re helping because it&#39;s fun.</p><p><br></p><p>With your help I can bring the tools to EOS that already exist on WAX … but make it in a way that works for the artist, rather than the investors and flippers.</p><p><br></p><p>The NFT scene needs to start building more tools that allow the artists to not only create NFTs, but to also display them in a way that makes sense to the artists vision. WAX began that process but has quickly been taken over by the big brand companies and the speculative collector.</p><p><br></p><p>EOS has a chance to be the next step that gives the power back to the individual artists that bring innovation.</p><p><br></p><p>EOS wants people to buy more EOS to keep it strong. We need to give people a reason to buy things with EOS. By building artist friendly tools, we can bring in music, songs, art and games and give people a reason to buy more EOS and grow the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what do I want to build?</strong></p><p>I would like to replicate NeftyBlocks for EOS, but make the artists page easily customizable for the artist, by the artist.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to bring the <a href=\"https://www.twosentencehorrors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Two Sentence Horrors</a> to EOS and show people that NFTs can be more than just a pretty picture.</p><p><br></p><p>I would also like to bring to life the Zombie Cats game that I started building with Nathan 8 months ago.</p><p><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaZkUg6SnubnD3ohBZkKtRznXVYieSucJzznZjxoQNc5F\"></p><p><br></p><p>By working closely with the developers we can be sure the tools and UIs they built, work for the non technically inclined and then start onboarding more artists into the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p><p>I would use the money to hire the developers that are already working for free in their spare time. Or, barring that, hire the developers they think are needed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Full disclosure</strong> - I don’t really know what is needed to build the things that I want, but I am surrounding myself with the people that know how. My expertise, besides art, is making a living by creating things. I’ve been doing it for a long time and I really want to use my experience and knowledge to help other artists earn a living creating art. All money will be put towards paying developers, and with some luck we can earn a passive income and become self funding.</p><p><br></p><p>My end game is to help artists from around the world make a living by creating their artwork.</p><p>If you have questions, find me on Twitter as @ArtistByron or on Telegram at t.me/byronsroom</p><p><br></p><p>I don&#39;t believe in hoarding things for myself. I believe very strongly in sharing what I know with whoever wants to know. The tools I am hoping to build are meant to be free for everyone. If there are fees that need to be paid, it would be to fund the developers that are building these tools and it is my strong desire that these fees are paid in a way that does not impact the end user or the artist. Fees suck, but sometimes they need to be paid to help keep the tools running smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a NOT FOR MY OWN PROFIT grant, even though I will benefit because it starts with my artwork. The end game is to help you or your friend earn a living by making NFTs on EOS.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>QUESTIONS ASKED</strong></p><p><em>are you willing to commit to making it open source? That means making the code publicly available for anyone to use/modify for their own purposes. their own clone.</em></p><p><strong>YES 100% committed </strong></p><p><em>You&#39;re building the building blocks artists and devs can use to make the interactive art experiences according to their vision</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>would be good to say you plan to make it compatible with AtomicAssets...</em></p><p><strong>IT HAS BEEN SAID - if you like what we build, please use the hell out of it and show us where we could have done it better.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Are you creating building blocks for AtomicAssets?</em></p><p><strong>YES - but I didn&#39;t know until someone told me so</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>My team consists of the gamification guru Scott (from Australia) - you can find him on Twitter at https://twitter.com/stargelnaz - he&#39;s next level smart</p><p>The other dude is named Michael but we all call him Clarkstachio - you can find him on Twitter at https://twitter.com/clarkstachio</p><p><br></p><p>We are all active on the discord for the Horde - you should join us https://discord.gg/rA3UMEkpqc</p>",

"description": "<h3>What is a Swarm?</h3><p>A Swarm represents <a href=\"https://github.com/duyluong1994/eos-multi-transfer-tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">open-source</a> Web3 technology and a large network of real humans who are incentivized to engage on social media content on Twitter. The value comes from the Bees engaging simultaneously. It creates amplified effects on the social media algorithms. It creates positive sentiment for Telos. </p><p><br></p><p>Amplifying and creating content produces freely consumable information about Telos. Because we can do it at scale (currently over 450 active bees), Swarms impact social listening tools, which further promotes Telos content to the broader crypto ecosystem. See examples in the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWe3ge-MYlM9pbaYvOaesIMQFVqlrUKF/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Case Study</a>. </p><p>Bees can submit a comment through our <a href=\"https://t.me/thebeesbot?start=w16969750\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chatbot</a>. If the comment is graded as GOOD or GREAT, the Bee will earn additional rewards. It’s a reinforced learn-to-earn mechanism that is meant to grow knowledgeable community members at scale. For season 6, we are limiting comments to bees who have shown proficiency in writing great comments.</p><p><br></p><h3>Swarm Selection</h3><p>In order to maximize the effectiveness of the Swarm, we select candidates based on Twitter #TLOS and $TLOS post rankings. Posts that already have some engagement are the best Swarm candidates. </p><h3><br></h3><h3>Swarm Cost </h3><p>The amount of 400 Bee (like/RT), 10 comment Swarms we can do depends on how much you choose to donate. The cost of one of these Swarms is $224 at our current scale. This cost includes:</p><ul><li>Like/RT rewards</li><li>Referral rewards</li><li>Comment rewards</li><li>Notification reminders when Swarms are live</li><li>Core team operations</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The maximum cap for any project is $2,400 donated. Reaching it would mean 11 Swarms. You can prorate the amount of Swarms depending on the total amount donated (plus matching):</p><p><br></p><p>11 Swarms | $2,400</p><p>6 Swarms | $1,344</p><p>3 Swarms | $672</p><p><br></p><h3>Data</h3><p>We use LunarCrush “<a href=\"https://lunarcrush.com/faq/metrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">social metrics</a>” to track the effectiveness of Swarms. LunarCrush’s Social Engagements (“LSE”) is analyzed across 7 cryptocurrencies. The graph below demonstrates that LSE may be correlated to market cap (“MC”). </p><p><br></p><p>Here is the ratio between LSE:MC across the basket of cryptos. We hypothesize that there will continue to be a positive correlation. For the basket of cryptos, we calculated a 10-day moving average across 320 days. </p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f26f5071-4b3f-4547-84b9-bb5688d671f5.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>In over 95% of cases, the LSE/MC ratio is between 0.009 and 0.001. This percentage increases to 99% if we exclude MATIC.</p><p><br></p><p>The graph shows there is a correlating trend that suggests that most cryptos have a similar LSE:MC ratio. It means that increasing LSE should correspond to an increase in MC, and vice-versa. </p><p><br></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><br></p><p>Please consider that it’s in the best interest of the Telos network to invest in LSE. The Bees have proven to directly affect LSE. </p><p><br></p><p>We are deeply grateful for every donation. Thank you for your consideration and support!</p><p><br></p>",

Yet, the network still has not rewarded this unwavering support with more content.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>NFTs and gaming has proven to be a powerful and successful combination across many other chains. EOS was not isolated from the NFT world — the AtomicAssets standard has already enabled a handful of content creators to issue, sell and reward their communities with artwork and collectibles. There is already an undeniable growth in quality and utility of EOS NFTs, with collections like Zombie Art, Pomelo, Animals EOSIO and the likes choosing this chain. However, the traction NFTs have on EOS doesn’t come close to what we see on WAX — a network built on the same technology using the same AtomicAssets standard. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>EOS is part of Wombats DNA, and we want to see this space thrive. That’s why we’ve built Dungeon Master to give gamers more content and to incentivize other creators to bring their amazing projects to EOS. Content creators are instrumental for the success of any chain, which is why our commitment to empowering them goes beyond making their NFTs stakeable. It means additional exposure, collaboration and adding over 10,000 people to their collectors ranks.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Since we started in December 2021, Dungeon Master has seen 100,000 NFTs staked on WAX and over 150,000 NFTs staked on EOS — by more than 50,000 unique players. These numbers alone are a testament to the fact that there is a vast community out there that is highly receptive to diverse high-quality content. We want to see more of it as well. At the same time, we’d love to be able to add more features to make our multi-chain staking game even more entertaining for our players. By allowing vetted NFT collections to be staked in Dungeon Master, we’ve already been providing additional utility to those NFTs. We have already fulfilled many intriguing concepts, and with your help, we will be able to deliver even more! </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Interested creators can already reach out to us here:</span></p><p><a href=\"https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply</a></p><p><br></p><h3><span>Our plans</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span>Back our pledges so we can keep making Dungeon Master a better game and venue for the creators. We will keep adding NFT collections for staking over the next seasons — or assist with launching one to give them more exposure even before they can be used. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Your backing will help us achieve the following milestones:</span></p><ul><li><span>Adding partner NFTs as rewards to the daily chests</span></li><li><span>Clans</span></li><li><span>Multiple Wombats as NFTs</span></li><li><span>Multiple Dungeons</span></li><li><span>Leaderboards</span></li><li><span>Name tags</span></li><li><span>Land</span></li><li><span>Season passes</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span>And many more.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>We hope that you would love to see all these changes in Dungeon Master too and that you will get behind our goals! &lt;3</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Dungeon Master</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span>Dungeon Master is a multi-chain staking game with thousands of active players and tons of awesome NFT collections to stake for loot!

"description": "<p><strong>Key points</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use: </strong>provide a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields</p><p><strong>2. Open source: </strong>smart contract library resource helping other EOS project team to build single-token staking reward system</p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost: </strong>attract inactive EOS tokens which will prosper ecosystem</p><p> </p><p><strong>Vault Protocol Introduction</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/vault\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vault protocol is the first single-token lossless yield protocol launched by Defibox. (https://eos.defibox.io/vault) </a>Users can earn corresponding token income by depositing tokens. The assets can be flexibly deposited and withdrawn with open and transparent on chain data. Valut income mainly comes from Defibox protocol income, Yield+ rewards, BP income, REX income, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the utility, the protocol will issue a standard EOS token called sToken, which represents a deposit certificate. sToken can be used in multiple DeFi protocols to obtain more benefits.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public goods that Vault brings</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use</strong></p><p>Vault is a decentralized single-token staking for public use. Any user or project team is able to use Vault. For EOS users, it is a very good yield tool to stake your EOS and get some good earning; For project team, it is possible to add your project token as a staking token in the future that will benefit your project and community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Open source</strong></p><p>Vault is a pioneer of decentralized a staking system which can be contributed to EOS smart contract library for the public reference in the later stage. Source code made available upon completion of ENF grant https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/pull/98</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost</strong></p><p>Most EOS tokens are not active on chain and this causes a big problem for EOS ecosystem. The ENF Yield+ Program is pointing the right direction - to increase on chain activities, to activate those dead EOS tokens. Vault protocol is moving towards the direction that Yield+ is pointing to. It is a powerful protocol that will attract inactive EOS tokens from CEX which will prosper ecosystem. It is not only taking the lead, but also an inspiration for other project teams when they build their own protocols: how to build a good protocol that has a good economic model which can fit EOS environment, activate on chain activities, win rewards from EOS, and give back to the community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Funds to raise:</strong></p><p>We hope to get 30,000 USD budget for Vault as development funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional Info:</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/d3e448cf-8962-43d4-bd82-e65a4a128a54.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">💯💥EOS Staking Challenge!</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://eos.defibox.io/lottery</a></p><p><br></p><p>🎉Go!

"description": "<h2><strong>main points:</strong></h2><ul><li>The DFI arbitration protocols is a set of technical documents</li><li>Open source, user instructions, continuous iteration</li><li>Community users can directly produce economic benefits</li><li>Help the emergence of high-frequency quantitative funds on EOS and prosper the ecology</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>brief introduction:</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Arbitrage is a decisive factor in the formation of modern efficient market (i.e. market equilibrium price). If the market does not reach equilibrium, there will be risk-free arbitrage opportunities in the market. Arbitrage Behavior helps to give full play to the function of price discovery. When arbitragers find abnormal price relations, they carry out arbitrage, which objectively makes various price relations in the market tend to be normal, so they can price assets in time more effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to more effectively price the defi assets on EOS in time and eliminate abnormal price relations, the defi arbitration protocols came into being. In addition, programmed robots contribute most of the transaction fees. To some extent, the defi arbitration protocols is of positive significance to improve the market making income of community users on DEX swap.</p><p><br></p><p>Defi arbitration protocols is a set of community open source protocols, including multiple protocols. Anyone can use them for free, and anyone can modify, add and upgrade them to jointly promote the development of EOS defi.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Current progress:</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>①DEX DEX arbitrage agreement, the spread arbitrage protocol between decentralized exchanges (defibox, DFS, newdex, Rome) based on eosio, it has been implemented and open source. When the price of a transaction pair in one of the above exchanges is higher or lower than that in other exchanges, the arbitrage protocol captures the price difference. If it can cover the transaction handling fee, it will buy in the exchange with low price and sell in the exchange with high price, and the transaction will be completed in the same block. <a href=\"https://github.com/akgod/EOS-DEX_arbitrage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/akgod/EOS-DEX_arbitrage</a></p><p><br></p><p>②Powerup-- CPU, Net resource auto lease script. No additional handling charge. The CPU and Net can only be rented for 24h in the new resource model powerup. In order to realize the high-frequency quantitative arbitrage account has resources to trade all the time, a script for automatically renewing resources is implemented based on eosjs. When the CPU or net is lower than a certain value, the script can automatically help you renew some 24-hour CPU or Net. This can improve the utilization of CPU and net of the arbitrage account, and avoid frequent resource leasing operations and a large number of idle resources.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/akgod/cpu_powerup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/akgod/cpu_powerup</a></p><p><br></p><p>③Option futures arbitrage protocol. At present, it has been realized on the centralized exchange. With the development of EOS defi, the option and futures protocol can be transplanted directly when they appear on eosio. <a href=\"https://github.com/akgod/option_arbitrage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/akgod/option_arbitrage</a></p><p><br></p><p>④CEX-DEX arbitrage protocol, that is arbitrage protocol between centralized exchange and decentralized exchange based on eosio. At present, it has been tested in a firm offer and will be announced by open source.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Future plans:</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>① Optimize the swap transaction path of the current DEX DEX protocol, and improve the efficiency of capturing arbitrage opportunities and sending transactions.</p><p><br></p><p>②Arbitrage of loan interest rate difference. Due to different market demand, the loan pool market of the defibox and pizza often has different loan interest rate, which is more obvious when the market is extreme. The development of interest rate difference arbitrage protocol can supplement liquidity to the loan pool with greater demand while realizing economic benefits, so as to facilitate community users.</p><p><br></p><p>③Statistical arbitrage protocol. Based on the analysis of historical data, the high probability events are counted and the arbitrage protocol is developed</p><p><br></p><p>④With the development of the cross-chain, the arbitrage protocols are based on eosio ,they will support arbitrage among multi chain assets.</p><p><br></p><p>⑤Help launch high-frequency quantitative fund based on eosio to benefit more people and create greater benefits for the community</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3>",

The service will include the ability to move tokens NFTs and other primitives across supported Antelope chains.

In the future will also have application specific integrations for advanced IBC use cases.</p><p><br></p><h2>Progress</h2><p>Our team has recently taken several steps to improve the stability and performance of our connection to the EOS chain for IBC transactions. First, we deployed new EOS P2P and API nodes to better support this functionality. Additionally, we have a deployed an IBC Server for both EOS and Telos, including the installation of a local Firehose endpoint on EOS. To make IBC transfers more accessible, we also launched a simple UI at https://ibc.animus.is.</p><p><br></p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Looking ahead, we are working to deploy new smart contracts for KROWN, BOID, and BBT tokens to take advantage of our new IBC bridge, and we have already begun preparing for WAX IBC endpoint deployment. We are also starting development of a friendly UI which will make interacting with IBC primitives easy and intuitive. Finally, we have ordered new hardware to increase our storage capacity and support our growing network requirements.</p><p><br></p><h2>Public Good?</h2><p>All code funded by this proposal will be open sourced. The API services we currently operate and user interfaces (for interacting with the contracts) will be hosted and maintained as a free service as long as this proposal is sufficiently funded.</p><p><br></p><h2>Join Us!</h2><p>We have a fresh group on Telegram!</p><p>https://t.me/antelopex</p>",

"description": "<p>Hi all, I would like to introduce to you the Russian-speaking EOS community - LikeEOS. We started almost three years ago by creating a telegram channel https://t.me/LikeEOS.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/230d56f2-8d8a-40f0-9808-04ecb8e6fe1c.png\"></p><p>Since then we try to inform our audience about all important events in the world of EOS, we tell about the most popular dapps and how to earn money, we translate articles, write instructions, warn about dangers. During this time, 934 posts have been published on the channel.</p><p><br></p><p>We are trying to use all available ways to spread information about EOS ecosystem, so we have accounts in social networks.</p><p><br></p><p>Telegram: https://t.me/LikeEOS</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/likeeosru</p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/likeeos.ru/</p><p>Facebook: https://facebook.com/groups/413910473758253/</p><p>Bywire: https://bywire.news/u/eosbees_russia</p><p>Youtube channels: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRV7xRzobrVLknZ2dr_6MLQ and https://www.youtube.com/@eosbeesrussianhive5920</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>EOS ecosystem is growing and developing, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to keep up with the news, translate articles about new dapps or important events in the EOS world. But it is necessary, and here&#39;s why:</p><p><br></p><p>Russian is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is spoken by more than 258 million people in 19 countries around the world!</p><p><br></p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers</p><p><br></p><p>And by the number of cryptocurrency users Russia is in the third place https://crypto.ru/rossiya-vhodit-top3-polzovatelej-kriptovalyut/</p><p><br></p><p>Also Russian is the 8th most used language on the Internet, according to this study https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, together with Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the share of Russian-speaking users of cryptocurrencies becomes very significant.</p><p><br></p><p>To keep abreast of everything that is happening around EOS, participate in community meetings, and then deliver important issues and information to the Russian-speaking community requires a lot of time, which of course is not enough. Therefore, we need your support to develop the Russian-speaking community further.</p>",

"description": "<p>EOCF, a crowdfunding platform hosted by EOS smart contracts</p><p> </p><p>We found the disadvantages of traditional crowdfunding platforms:</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>Crowdfunding funds are centrally managed by the platform. There are risks of the platform going bankrupt and being regulated.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> The project team lacks a supervision mechanism and lacks an audit of the use of funds.</em></p><p><strong><em>3.</em></strong><em> Investors participating in crowdfunding have no incentive mechanism and are not highly motivated.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em>The work progress of the funded team is not limited.</em></p><p> </p><p>We will use EOS smart contracts to develop a decentralized crowdfunding platform.</p><p> </p><h4>Fund Management Design:</h4><p>Fund management is decentralized and hosted in a smart contract. After the development is completed, our team will give up the transfer authority of the smart contract hosting the funds. Give the authority to the EOS nodes for multi-signature management or black hole. Our team will not have the authority to transfer investors&#39; funds.</p><p> </p><h4>Basic design:</h4><p>Crowdfunding funds will be unlocked in batches depending on investor votes:</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is an open platform where anyone can initiate a project and seek investor support.</em></p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><em>Project teams that accept crowdfunding must set the upper and lower limits of the crowdfunding amount. When the lower limit is reached, the project is deemed to be launched, and the investor&#39;s funds will be locked in the smart contract, waiting to be unlocked in batches. If the expiration date does not exceed the lower limit, the project will be considered a failed crowdfunding. It needs to be restarted and the investor can get his funds (EOS) back from the smart contract.</em></p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><em>Teams that accept crowdfunding must reach the set delivery goals and apply for unlocked funds. Project funds are unlocked in batches, and all investors need to vote through smart contracts to unlock funds to the project team in batches.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em> Investor voting weight is realized through algorithm. The algorithm will find a balance of weights between large and small investors. When a certain turnout is reached, the smart contract will release funds to the project party. The algorithm formula will be fully open sourced on Github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Innovative design:</h4><p>We designed the one-time unlocking mode, which is different from the batch-based unlocking mode.</p><p> </p><p>Project teams that accept crowdfunding can set up a result of working first,then receiving funds. When the project team achieve the goal, then the investors vote to approve it, the crowdfunding funds will be released at one time.This design is for the project team that accepts crowdfunding to make promises and products that are beneficial to investors, and after self-funding to complete the goal, a one-time vote to release all the crowdfunding funds to the project team.This innovative design allows crowdfunding while working. With the progress and development of the project, more and more people will participate in crowdfunding, and the project team will receive more funds at one time.</p><p> </p><h4>Public Goods Section:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is a project that one person can participate in. There is no curtain. Anyone can publish the project and accept crowdfunding. Anyone can become an investor.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> All parts of the project involving smart contracts and algorithms will be open sourced and removed on github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Benefits to the EOS ecosystem:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>Smart contracts are developed and deployed in the main network. Crowdfunding EOS uses EOS as the base currency, and T contains USD on EOS.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em>This crowdfunding platform will first serve the project teams of the EOS community and help EOS projects. Improve the EOS ecological environment.Increase the usage and liquidity of EOS.</em></p><p> </p>",

It constitutes a safe and sustainable alternative asset suitable to meet the financial needs for diversification, investment, and store of value of individuals. EO2 is also a tool to offset individuals&#39; and businesses&#39; carbon emissions more reliable and effective than those currently available in the mass market.</p><p> </p><p>EO2&#39;s Mission is to contribute to a more inclusive, efficient, and reliable Carbon Market by providing all stakeholders with easier access to quality Carbon Credits, which are currently accessible to a limited number of multinational enterprises. Our goal is achieved through tokenizing regulated Carbon Credits into EO2, which reduces frictions and improves their usability and diffusion.</p><p>The core project function is represented in a smart contract that constitutes a two-way bridge between off-chain regulated Carbon Credits and their in-chain Token representation.</p><p> </p><p>For a quick overview of EO2 project, you can take a look to the promo <a href=\"https://youtu.be/webvzEuRnRY\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>video</strong></a>.</p><p> </p><p>EO2 has achieved considerable progress in developing the UI, which has been designed considering our target users&#39; different levels of experience with technology and digital assets.

"summary": "",
"description": "<p>Dear community</p><p><br></p><p>My name is Lukas Mantinger, I am an active Eden member since the beginning and I&#39;m excited to present to you our <em>english</em> to <em>german</em> translation project of Daniel Larimers book <em>More Equal Animals - The subtile Art of True Democracy.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Back in summer 2021 I came up with the idea to translate Dan&#39;s book into my native language. My aim was to help spread Dan&#39;s ideas in the german speaking community to make it more accessible for people who are not proficient in English. Soon I realized though, that my English was too weak to do the job, so I asked my friend <em>@marconamaste</em> for help. We agreed on 5,000 Euro worth of EOS for the translation. So together with small EOS translation group, including telegramusers @<em>orasapte</em> and @<em>RubixLoop</em> from <a href=\"http://EOSsupport.io\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>EOSsupport.io</em></a> we went for it.</p><p><br></p><p>To mitigate risks of a highly volatile market on both sites <em>@marconamaste</em> and I agreed to an energy compensation of 5 installments (1,000 Euro each) at the end of every month with the EOS price on the very last day of the according month. So while in the beginning of this project EOS was around $6, during the 5 months it changed (you know where it went) and finally a total 1,415 EOS was transferred to my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>During our collaboration I could motivate my friend to take a look at the Eden and its ecosystem. I was glad to see him join after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I was ready to pay the whole amount out of my own pocket. I wanted to get this project moving - I was convinced of it, and I had the capabilities to finance it. Do not complain - simply do it! Right? But after some time I thought: aren&#39;t we actually creating a valuable public good from which the whole community benefits? A large group might be interested in helping getting these promising projects financed. I also spoke about it on our first Eden elections in october last year and got some funding assured (which is mentioned at the beginning of the book).</p><p><br></p><p>In this spirit I created this grant, and with the idea to invest the eventually surplus (after reaching 1,415 EOS) in the production of a high quality audiobook of this german version of <em>More Equal Animals, </em>again in collaboration with <em>@marconamaste </em>and a printversion which @<em>orasapte (</em>pomelouser horst4) runs his own grant for. Further we will use the capital to reach a bigger audience.</p><p><br></p><p>There&#39;s over a 100 million native German speakers worldwide, all speakers included, about 185 million people - there is a lot of potential. This project will add great value to EOS and help a lot of people open their eyes to a true realistic and alternative way of <em>doing</em> politics and society.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost any human organization faces power centralization over time. Daniel shows in this book ways to mitigate those effects and explains how to make governance more fair and efficient. Daniel Larimer has experience in building communities since almost 10 years, in which he developed and distributed software for several decentralized systems. Many of these experiences, including the essence of the governance issues that the EOS community has been facing since launch of mainnet and possible solutions to them, are packed into this small book. So it is also a must read for everyone looking for a broader approach to <em>blockchainsdecentralized decision-making</em> and <em>general</em> government structures - besides <em>bare</em> capital gains.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3kx1KVFXzYKdjOe4o5a0xqGz0quWE8I/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">The german version of <em>More Equal Animals </em>&#34;<em>Gleichere Tiere, die subtile Kunst echter Demokratie&#34; </em>can be downloaded here for private use and is completely free. Spread the word!</a></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your support!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Liebe Gemeinschaft,</p><p><br></p><p>Mein Name ist Lukas Mantinger und aktives Eden-Mitglied von Anfang an. Ich freue mich euch unser Englisch-Deutsch-Übersetzungsprojekt von Daniel Larimers Buch More Equal Animals - The subtile Art of True Democracy vorzustellen.</p><p><br></p><p>Im Sommer 2021 kam mir die Idee, Dans Buch in meine Muttersprache zu übersetzen. Mein Ziel war es, dabei zu helfen, Dans Ideen im deutschsprachigen Sprachraum zu verbreiten und sie für Menschen ohne Englischkenntnisse zugänglicher zu machen. Bald merkte ich jedoch, dass mein Englisch für eine halbwegs hochwertige Übersetzung nicht ausreichte, also bat ich meinen Freund @marconamaste um Hilfe. Wir haben uns für die Übersetzung auf EOS im Wert von 5.000 Euro geeinigt. Zusammen mit einer kleinen EOS-Übersetzungsgruppe, darunter Telegramnutzer @orasapte und @RubixLoop von <a href=\"http://EOSsupport.io\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>EOSsupport.io</em></a>, sind wir an die Sache rangegangen.</p><p><br></p><p>Um das Risiko des volatilen Marktes auf beiden Seiten zu minimieren, haben @marconamaste und ich abgemacht, die Vergütung in 5 Raten (je 1.000 Euro) am Ende jedes Monats mit dem EOS-Preis am letzten Tag des jeweiligen Monats zu entrichten. Während der EOS-Preis zu Beginn dieses Projekts bei etwa 6 US-Dollar lag, änderte er sich während der 5 Monate nicht unerheblich (ihr wisst, wohin es ging) und schließlich wurden meinem Freund insgesamt 1.415 EOS überwiesen.</p><p><br></p><p>Während unserer Zusammenarbeit konnte ich ihn dazu motivieren, einen Blick auf Eden und sein Ökosystem zu werfen. Ich war froh, ihn nach einiger Zeit beitreten zu sehen.</p><p><br></p><p>Zunächst war ich bereit, den gesamten Betrag aus eigener Tasche zu bezahlen. Ich wollte dieses Projekt auf den Weg bringen – ich war davon überzeugt, und ich hatte die Möglichkeiten, es zu finanzieren. Nicht meckern - einfach mal machen! Nicht? Aber nach einiger Zeit dachte ich: Schaffen wir nicht eigentlich ein wertvolles öffentliches Gut, von dem die ganze Gemeinschaft profitiert? Eine größere Gruppe könnte daran interessiert sein, bei der Finanzierung dieser vielversprechenden Projekte zu helfen. Auch habe ich das Thema bei unseren ersten Eden-Wahlen im Oktober letzten Jahres angesprochen und mir wurde finanzielle Unterstützung zugesprochen, was am Anfang des Buches auch erwähnt wird.</p><p><br></p><p>In diesem Sinne habe ich dieses Pomelo-Stipendium geschaffen, und mit der Idee, den eventuellen Überschuss (nach Erreichen von 1.415 EOS) in die Produktion eines hochwertigen Hörbuchs dieser deutschen Version von More Equal Animals zu investieren, wiederum in Zusammenarbeit mit @marconamaste und eventuell in eine Druckversion des Buches, für die @<em>orasapte </em>(pomelonutzer horst4) sein eigenes Pomelo-Stipendium betreibt. Außerdem werden wir das Kapital nutzen, um ein größeres Publikum zu erreichen.</p><p><br></p><p>Weltweit gibt es über 100 Millionen deutsche Muttersprachler, alle Sprecher eingeschlossen, etwa 185 Millionen Menschen – das Potential ist groß. Dieses Projekt wird EOS einen großen Mehrwert bringen und vielen Menschen helfen, ihre Augen für eine wirklich realistische und alternative Art und Weise zu öffnen, Politik und Gesellschaft zu organisieren.</p><p><br></p><p>Fast jede menschliche Organisation sieht sich im Laufe der Zeit einer Machtzentralisierung ausgesetzt. Daniel zeigt in diesem Buch Wege auf, diese Auswirkungen abzumildern, und erklärt, wie man Führungsstrukturen fairer und effizienter gestalten kann. Daniel Larimer hat seit fast 10 Jahren Erfahrung im Aufbau von organisierten Gemeinschaften für deren dezentrale Organisation er Software Systeme entwickelt hat. Viele dieser Erfahrungen, darunter die Essenz der Governance-Probleme, die die EOS-Community seit dem Start des Mainnets diskutiert und mögliche Lösungen dafür, sind in diesem kleinen Werk verpackt. Es ist auch eine Pflichtlektüre für alle, die neben den bloßen Kapitalgewinnen einen breiteren Ansatz für Blockchains, dezentrale Entscheidungsfindung und allgemeine Regierungsstrukturen suchen.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3kx1KVFXzYKdjOe4o5a0xqGz0quWE8I/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">Die deutsche Version von More Equal Animals &#34;Gleichere Tiere, die subtile Kunst echter Demokratie&#34; kann hier für den privaten Gebrauch heruntergeladen werden und ist völlig kostenlos. Verbreitet das Wort!</a></p><p><br></p><p>Danke für eure Unterstützung!</p>",

"description": "<p><strong>Key points</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use: </strong>provide a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields</p><p><strong>2. Open source: </strong>smart contract library resource helping other EOS project team to build single-token staking reward system</p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost: </strong>attract inactive EOS tokens which will prosper ecosystem</p><p> </p><p><strong>Vault Protocol Introduction</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/vault\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vault protocol is the first single-token lossless yield protocol launched by Defibox. (https://eos.defibox.io/vault) </a>Users can earn corresponding token income by depositing tokens. The assets can be flexibly deposited and withdrawn with open and transparent on chain data. Valut income mainly comes from Defibox protocol income, Yield+ rewards, BP income, REX income, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the utility, the protocol will issue a standard EOS token called sToken, which represents a deposit certificate. sToken can be used in multiple DeFi protocols to obtain more benefits.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public goods that Vault brings</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use</strong></p><p>Vault is a decentralized single-token staking for public use. Any user or project team is able to use Vault. For EOS users, it is a very good yield tool to stake your EOS and get some good earning; For project team, it is possible to add your project token as a staking token in the future that will benefit your project and community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Open source</strong></p><p>Vault is a pioneer of decentralized a staking system which can be contributed to EOS smart contract library for the public reference in the later stage. Source code made available upon completion of ENF grant https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/pull/98</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost</strong></p><p>Most EOS tokens are not active on chain and this causes a big problem for EOS ecosystem. The ENF Yield+ Program is pointing the right direction - to increase on chain activities, to activate those dead EOS tokens. Vault protocol is moving towards the direction that Yield+ is pointing to. It is a powerful protocol that will attract inactive EOS tokens from CEX which will prosper ecosystem. It is not only taking the lead, but also an inspiration for other project teams when they build their own protocols: how to build a good protocol that has a good economic model which can fit EOS environment, activate on chain activities, win rewards from EOS, and give back to the community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Funds to raise:</strong></p><p>We hope to get 30,000 USD budget for Vault as development funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional Info:</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/d3e448cf-8962-43d4-bd82-e65a4a128a54.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">💯💥EOS Staking Challenge!</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://eos.defibox.io/lottery</a></p><p><br></p><p>🎉Go!

Yet, the network still has not rewarded this unwavering support with more content.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>NFTs and gaming has proven to be a powerful and successful combination across many other chains. EOS was not isolated from the NFT world — the AtomicAssets standard has already enabled a handful of content creators to issue, sell and reward their communities with artwork and collectibles. There is already an undeniable growth in quality and utility of EOS NFTs, with collections like Zombie Art, Pomelo, Animals EOSIO and the likes choosing this chain. However, the traction NFTs have on EOS doesn’t come close to what we see on WAX — a network built on the same technology using the same AtomicAssets standard. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>EOS is part of Wombats DNA, and we want to see this space thrive. That’s why we’ve built Dungeon Master to give gamers more content and to incentivize other creators to bring their amazing projects to EOS. Content creators are instrumental for the success of any chain, which is why our commitment to empowering them goes beyond making their NFTs stakeable. It means additional exposure, collaboration and adding over 10,000 people to their collectors ranks.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Since we started in December 2021, Dungeon Master has seen 100,000 NFTs staked on WAX and over 150,000 NFTs staked on EOS — by more than 50,000 unique players. These numbers alone are a testament to the fact that there is a vast community out there that is highly receptive to diverse high-quality content. We want to see more of it as well. At the same time, we’d love to be able to add more features to make our multi-chain staking game even more entertaining for our players. By allowing vetted NFT collections to be staked in Dungeon Master, we’ve already been providing additional utility to those NFTs. We have already fulfilled many intriguing concepts, and with your help, we will be able to deliver even more! </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Interested creators can already reach out to us here:</span></p><p><a href=\"https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply</a></p><p><br></p><h3><span>Our plans</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span>Back our pledges so we can keep making Dungeon Master a better game and venue for the creators. We will keep adding NFT collections for staking over the next seasons — or assist with launching one to give them more exposure even before they can be used. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Your backing will help us achieve the following milestones:</span></p><ul><li><span>Adding partner NFTs as rewards to the daily chests</span></li><li><span>Clans</span></li><li><span>Multiple Wombats as NFTs</span></li><li><span>Multiple Dungeons</span></li><li><span>Leaderboards</span></li><li><span>Name tags</span></li><li><span>Land</span></li><li><span>Season passes</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span>And many more.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>We hope that you would love to see all these changes in Dungeon Master too and that you will get behind our goals! &lt;3</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Dungeon Master</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span>Dungeon Master is a multi-chain staking game with thousands of active players and tons of awesome NFT collections to stake for loot!

Unicove is also open-source, so if developers wanted to apply the same EVM bridge model to their own projects, they could do so.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who We Are: </strong>Greymass is an expert team of researchers and developers who have been with the EOS network since day 1, helping to launch the network with eos-voter (which later became Anchor). We’ve been contributing to the network as block producers and product developers ever since. Learn more about us at <a href=\"http://greymass.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://greymass.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why build an EVM bridge in Unicove?</h2><p><br></p><p>Right now, both the EOS and Telos networks have a fully functional EVMs. This is great, because it gives the network a chance to attract developers and innovative projects that can be built in Solidity, a more well-known smart contract language than Antelope’s C++. </p><p><br></p><p>But having the EVM is only half the battle. Now that it’s here, the network needs supporting infrastructure – tools that make it easier for both users and developers to engage with the EVM. We believe that easy-to-use EVM bridges (i.e., ways to swap Antelope-based tokens to EVM-based tokens) are a crucial part of this infrastructure, because they allow users to access tokens that they can use in EVM-based dApps. This bridge will serve as Unicove&#39;s first EVM-based feature as we continue to explore how best it can serve the Antelope ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>While the network currently has a free-standing bridge courtesy of the ENF, we want to lower the barrier to entry by putting an EVM bridge directly in our Unicove web wallet. This will give more users the opportunity to swap tokens, since all Unicove users will have direct access without having to leave their wallet.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why trust Greymass to build it?</h2><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>We have extensive experience building wallets for the EOS community.</strong> Our very first product for the network was a wallet, and we’ve kept the legacy going. Today, we offer two wallet products: the Anchor wallet (available for iOS, Android, and desktop!) and the Unicove web wallet. With the lessons we’ve learned along the way, we feel confident that we can deliver a user-friendly EVM bridge within the Unicove wallet.</li><li><strong>This isn’t our first rodeo. </strong>Feel free to look up our past Pomelo pitches – we’ve now participated in multiple Pomelo seasons, and every time, we’ve delivered on our promises.</li><li><strong>Greymass is an Antelope-native company. </strong>Having been with the network since Day 1, we’re committed to helping EOS and the Antelope ecosystem succeed. We’re passionate about distributed ledger technology, and using it to help lift up the communities we’re a part of. </li></ol>",

"summary": "EasyElm-EOS facilitates the interaction of EOS smart contracts using the Elm programing language. It's an open source tool developed internally at Cambiatus that facilitates and speeds up software development.",
"description": "<p>Interacting with contracts from web apps can be challenging. We need to send the data in the correct format, which is very easy to get wrong and can be a difficult problem to diagnose. At development time, application developers need to consult the contract implementation (or a block explorer) to find out what data the contract accepts. The developer also needs to &#34;translate&#34; the data - from the app&#39;s language to the language the contract understands. Furthermore, if a team makes any changes to the contract, it can be difficult for other teams to notice this change and adapt the application, which can lead to errors for end users.</p><p><br></p><p>Eos contracts have an ABI (Application Binary Interface) - a document that specifies all the data that the contract can receive or send to other applications. We can use these ABIs to generate code that facilitates interaction with contracts using the Elm language. Due to the functionalities that Elm has, this makes it impossible to send incorrect data to contracts, in addition to facilitating and speeding up the work of web developers. The generated code provides all the information a developer needs to interact with contracts (no need to consult the contract implementation or a block explorer), and eliminates the step of translating the Elm data into the language the contract understands.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to generating code that developers can use to interact with contracts, we can generate forms, pages, or even entire applications to interact with contracts.This way someone who has developed a contract and wants a simple application to use or test the contract can publish an application on the public internet from a single button click. Developers who want more control can generate forms or pages that can be used in their existing applications.</p><p><br></p><p>The public good that we are developing in Cambiatus is the use of ABIs, found in EOS contracts, to facilitate the interaction with contracts using the Elm language, as well as tools for automatic generation of forms, pages and applications. This good is non-rival as the entire developer community can benefit and learn from it. It is also characterized as non-exclusive because it will be available free of charge (open source) for anyone who wants to access and contribute.</p><p><br></p><p>We plan to work in the following milestones:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>An Elm library for describing the types of data that e-contracts understand</li><li> A command-line application for parsing ABIs and generating Elm code</li><li>Generate code to interact with contracts</li><li> Generate code to create forms</li><li> Generate code to create pages</li><li> Generate code to build apps</li></ul><p><br></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/26/deploying-with-the-click-of-a-button/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deploy with Netlify</a> (or similar) button that is customizable to create an application and make it accessible on the internet</p><p><br></p><p>With the funds from this grant, we our solution will allow application developers to have greater ease and agility to interact with contracts and contract developers will be able to have an app to test and use their contracts at the click of a button.</p><p><br></p><p>The tool is available to use in beta mode, just follow this steps:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Install the Elm library and code generation tool and use it to parse contracts.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li> Follow the instructions available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/henriquecbuss/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repository</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Deliverables are:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/henriquecbuss/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repository</a> (project source code, which also includes documentation and usage examples)</li><li><a href=\"https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/henriquecbuss/elm-eos/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elm package</a> (installable package to be used in development)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">Npm package</a> (installable package that comes with the executable to parse ABIs and generate Elm code)</li><li>Elm &lt;-&gt; eos data type mapping</li><li> Code generation to read contract tables</li><li> Generating code to submit transactions to contracts</li><li> Automatic construction of forms</li><li> Automatic construction of pages, where each page corresponds to a table or action of a contract.</li><li> Automatic building of applications</li><li>Community support through discord / telegram channels</li><li>Create educational content for developers</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We plan to raise at least usd 16.000 for this tool, and the money will be used for:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Software development - 10k</li><li>Build, test and iterate the mentioned in the milestones and deliverables</li><li>Community building initiatives - 6k</li><li>Community support through discord/telegram channels, educational content for the EOS / Elm community</li></ul><p><br></p><p>About Cambiatus:</p><p><br></p><p>Cambiatus has been collaborating with the EOS community in Latin America since 2018.

This means users will transfer a single NFT for a Single Fungible Token representing a 1NFT:1.0000 Token ratio. This means users can easily swap between a token and non-fungible token. By allowing users to swap between tokens for other tokens and tokenized NFTs, we allow for fractional purchases of NFT assets. This enables economies to more conveniently swap large amounts of NFT &amp; FTs.</p><p><br></p><p>The Immersys Dex takes it a step further by creating a multi-token liquidity pool which enables the swap of every token amongst itself. The individual tokens weight in the pool can be adjusted to avoid significant impermanent loss. Users can fill the pool with equal parts USDT, Eos, Fate, Tokenized NFT#1, Tokenized NFT#2, Tokenized NFT#3 and swap between them.

Our primary goal in our campaign was to bring utility to eos.io NFTs. Not only can you now import eos.io NFTs into Immersys, you can also import Polygon, Solana, Flow and Ethereum NFTs. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Immersys has continued to make major headway in improving the platform. Below are just some of the additions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Created a comic book viewer for NFT comic book creators</strong></li><li><strong>Refined our NFT spawn capability to also allow 3D NFTs</strong></li><li><strong>Created the ability to play music NFTs</strong></li><li><strong>Introduced both retail and residential properties that you can now purchase on atomichub and </strong></li><li><strong>Added the capability for creators to sell wearables such as pins, masks and clothing</strong></li><li><strong>Full Avatars with legs that you can customize and decorate with wearables</strong></li><li><strong>Battle arena where you can battle other players and monsters</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>For Season 3 pomelo, we would like to build a system for players to be able to directly obtain the in-game currency token called Fate.

This is what life changing art is all about. NFTs allow for ownership of digital art, and thus, essential for freedom of expression in the modern world. Immersys can serve to showcase the advantages of EOS transactions over other blockchains. Together,<strong> Immersys+EOS </strong>delivers a public good non-existent nor possible on most blockchains.</p><h3><br></h3><p>The average person wants to at least try crypto. No one wants to pay exorbitant fees. EOS offers both a low/no-cost and easier onboarding experience than what’s available on blockchains with much larger market caps. </p><p><br></p><h3>Assured Public Good</h3><p>Done properly, this motivational approach toward onboarding can be sustained such that few people ever leave Immersys without their own EOS address. This stands apart as a <em>non-rivalrous public good</em> that Pomelo funding can help achieve.</p><p><br></p><h3>Boundless Utility</h3><p>As one understands what the Immersys project is all about, it’s clear that onboarding is only the beginning. NFT utility expands via virtual stores, in-game display, and dapp convergence. The ability for both developers and players to manipulate and mine NFTs makes for boundless potential. Factor in advanced play-to-earn dynamics alongside a new EOS Dawn, and it becomes clear that we’re on the cutting edge of something special.</p><h1><br></h1><h1><strong>EXPERIENCE A NEW KIND OF VIRTUAL WORLD</strong></h1><p><br></p><p>The Immersys team dares to dream of an unbound vision of the metaverse. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/metaverse-definition-5206578\" rel=\"nofollow\">Investopedia</a>’s definition includes:</p><ul><li>...combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact...</li></ul><p>Whether due to challenges or laziness, many metaverse projects fail to meet these criterias. Projects seeking to ride the buzz over crypto or VR won’t get there alone. When things become difficult, as is so often the case with innovation, profit mining and discontinued support can dwindle a bright idea. </p><p><br></p><p>The future is so obviously virtual. Global technological mediums just need to catch up. It’s only recently that the world began to accept crypto. A virtual world without cryptocurrencies is preposterous. Blockchain is the only way to own and transfer digital assets in a way that can satisfy a large, independent marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to combining all the essential elements of a metaverse, Immersys enables users to spawn their NFTs anywhere in the world. Projects can easily integrate with the world via a connected portal in the hub. Players can add their personal touch to things like masks and other wearables. </p><p><br></p><p>Immersys is an aggressive project. It’s proving successful at maintaining robust versatility for both players and project development teams.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>VIRTUAL ECONOMY </strong></h1><p>Immersys is an exciting venue for point-of-sale NFTs. Incorporating browsers expands upon the consumer base for markets like Atomic Hub on EOS. In-game purchase also means convenience and time saving for players. Investors gain a new medium to diversify and expand their audiences. Taken together, these aspects profoundly add to the public good.</p><h3>Play-to-Earn</h3><p><br></p><p>Play-to-earn is the future. It’s an economic driver needed to advance beyond the bittersweet reality of Big Tech. In Immersys, individuals not only own NFTs but also the real estate (shops and connected worlds).</p><p><br></p><p>Immersys is capable of plugging in new worlds/games like Legos (or Minecraft blocks). A metaverse needs to be open and easily integrated. One visit to the hub and you&#39;ll feel this.</p><p><br></p><h3>VR Integration</h3><p>Immersys is ready for the future and in step with an economy transitioning toward a virtual online experience. It’s also VR ready from day one.</p>",

Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.” </em></h2><h2><em>- Kofi Annan</em></h2><p> </p><p><br></p><p>Bywire is best known for our news coverage and our unique ‘Trust or Not’ algorithm which helps inform readers if content is likely to be reliable or not. Using this technology, we discovered we could help potential investors understand, at-a-glance, both the current state and potential of EOS. We could use the data to not only demonstrate the potential, but to also help guide the future. Shaping our empirical approach we could dismiss the anecdotal emotional despair to the past and finally point to the data and show the world the unmatched technological superiority of EOS, and remind them that the EOS community is battle hardened, and foundation ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Building this technology, we used techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, collecting data from a myriad of sources. We use artificial neural networks at several stages in our analysis to improve the data quality, map text parameters, and classify data from various channels, such as online news and social media.</p><p> </p><p>Then we realised something incredible. This technology could be also used to help build a tool that would allow us to track brand, influencer, crypto and stock sentiments and activity. It would allow us to see how online conversations affected key indicators such as brand sentiment, and the price of cryptocurrencies, stocks, or any asset type. Is there a correlation? Can we use past data to help predict future outcomes? </p><p> </p><p>We decided to go ahead and build it. We then realised it would cost a mountain of cash, and staring at our molehill, we could foresee problems. Thankfully, the EOS Network Foundation believed in our crazy ambitions, and funded us with enough resources to build the platform, so long as we made the EOS version permanently available to everyone in the EOS community, for free.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/15347465-8669-4203-bfbc-3a5501998247.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/17cdd9b6-39bb-45f7-802b-f0937594ec37.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f6518c13-a9c4-49df-b41f-e74df2514ecf.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, we are happy to present the Bywire Audience Intelligence Platform (Launching July 26): <a href=\"https://bywire.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bywire.ai</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introducing Bywire Audience Intelligence (Bywire AI)</strong></p><p> </p><p>Market forces are directed by human or artificial intelligent powered actors, who have common behaviours and repeatable patterns. These are mapped from their decisions, all of which are influenced by their opinions, which are informed by data such as sentiment, probability, and predictability.</p><p> </p><p>This applies to humans and artificial intelligence. But this type of analysis is typically reserved for large corporations given it is expensive to run and maintain. Bywire is aiming to bring this platform to the world, because we believe that this vital information about EOS should remain non-exclusionary and non-rivalrous. </p><p> </p><p>Therefore, we are asking the EOS community to fund this grant application for us to continue to update the data behind the platform, each month. Many parts of the platform are automated, but key elements still require human analysis. Therefore, the funds raised will be used to continue to automate as many functions as possible, reducing the ongoing monthly costs, and to scrape, collect and analyse fresh data each month. </p><p> </p><p>There is also an even bigger benefit. Investors can use this platform to at-a-glance better understand both the growth and potential of EOS, because the data will prove it. No more anecdotal debates, here is the data that shows EOS is a world-beater, and this community is growing.</p><p> </p><p>EOS is returning, and now, finally, we all have the data to prove it. </p><p><em> </em></p><p>~<strong>Costs</strong>:</p><ul><li>Monthly running costs: $3000 ($12,000 target to cover four months)</li><li>Automation development and UI improvements: $10,000 per month ($40,000 target to cover four months)</li><li>Target: $52,000</li></ul><p> </p><h1>Learn more about the Bywire Story</h1><p><br></p>[youtube]qycPsN0D05A[/youtube]<p><br></p>",

"description": "<p>Contribute to the next generation of public API services by Greymass as we look to expand our capacity to support more applications across EOS.</p><p><br></p><p>Over 3 years ago our small team started offering free publicly accessible APIs to the EOS community. Since then many EOS token holders have used our public services, both knowingly and unknowingly. <a href=\"https://greymass.com/en/apis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Our public APIs</a> have served hundreds of billions of requests since their launch in late 2018. Many EOS wallets, block explorers, and applications take advantage of this freely accessible data to provide their users with the information they need. The Greymass team also depends on these services to bring projects like <a href=\"https://greymass.com/en/anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anchor</a> and <a href=\"https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/unicove-your-portal-to-eosio-blockchains/4877\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unicove</a> to the community for free.</p><p><br></p><p>We achieved all this by making an initial investment in late 2018 of over $100,000 USD, when Greymass purchased its own hardware and set up a data center in Michigan, US. This investment was dual purpose, to meet our needs as application developers and to meet the needs of the broader community with public access. Through 2019-2021 we were able to operate using this hardware alongside distributed server rentals to provide global coverage with minimal overhead and additional costs.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we are looking to expand and improve this public offering by adding a second data center with next generation hardware. Not only will this allow us to increase our capacity, but we will also be adding redundancy to prevent future downtime. We have leased a new space in Vancouver, CA and are starting the process of setting up our 2nd data center. Hardware specifications for future purchases are being defined and additional manpower being brought on board to help us deploy, manage, and monitor it all.</p><p><br></p><p>With a growing Greymass team and <a href=\"https://github.com/greymass\" rel=\"nofollow\">suite of open source products</a> to manage, we are limited in how fast we can allocate capital. This is where we want to give Pomelo and the greater EOS community a chance to step in and help! We are seeking contributions to assist in this effort to bring this new data center online for public use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We currently estimate that this new data center will be operational and in use in the first half of 2022. Our rough estimate of a timeline is as follows:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Location (Complete)</strong>: Research suitable locations and compare.</li><li><strong>Commitment (Complete)</strong>: Select location, complete paperwork, and sign lease.</li><li><strong>Purchasing (EOY 2021)</strong>: Research, get quotes, and order components needed.</li><li><strong>Hiring (Q1 2022): </strong>Bring on additional team members to assist with management.</li><li><strong>Installing (Q1 2022)</strong>: Physical installation of hardware on-site.</li><li><strong>Configuring (Q1/2 2022)</strong>: Configuring servers, installing software, begin limited operations.</li><li><strong>Launch (Q1/2 2022)</strong>: Bring services online as they become available and route traffic.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Use of Funds:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The following outlines what sort of costs we will incur in order to complete this new deployment.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Hardware Costs</strong>: New servers and equipment will be purchased, configured, and installed in our new data center.</li><li><strong>Professional Services</strong>: Additional services required for this setup may be outsourced to external businesses/experts.</li><li><strong>New Hires</strong>: We currently are onboarding additional members to our team to help manage this increased workload.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Greymass will provide transparent reporting on the allocations of these funds. Any additional funds received above and beyond what we require for the initial deployment will be put towards future overhead that this project will inevitably incur.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Use of Servers:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>All of the hardware we purchase gets put to work on various tasks. To give you a sense of all the components we operate in our data center that services the EOS network, here&#39;s a small list of the roles some of our servers will have in the new data center.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Fuel APIs</strong>: Provides users access to both free and paid CPU, NET, and RAM on a per-transaction basis.</li><li><strong>History APIs</strong>: Servers to make data freely available from the full history of EOS.</li><li><strong>Internal APIs</strong>: Local servers available for Fuel and other services to access on-chain state.</li><li><strong>Internal Peering</strong>: Servers available to facilitate transaction and block communication in our private network.</li><li><strong>Transaction Estimation</strong>: Servers designed to simulate transactions and estimate their CPU, NET, and RAM costs for use in Anchor and Fuel.</li><li><strong>Trace Generation</strong>: Servers capable of processing the results of every transaction performed on the network for use in our history solution.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>About Us:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://greymass.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greymass</a> is an organization contributing to the development of technologies for EOSIO networks.

The project party can configure the trading transaction rate by itself, as well as designate the fee collection account, and the market making reward for the corresponding trading pair. It has absolute discourse on the market making of project tokens. right.</p><p><br></p><h2>Aggregate Transactions (Published)</h2><p>At present, in addition to the mainstream swaps such as Defibox, Great Harvest, and pizza, more and more projects have developed their own swaps in the eos ecosystem. Each swap has its own different trading pairs and pool depths, leading to user transactions. It is often necessary to switch back and forth between various swaps. In order to facilitate users to trade between various swaps, OBSwap’s original aggregated transaction integrates major mainstream swaps. When transferring money, you only need to bring a contract and a corresponding currency on the memo. The name can implement the best trading strategy, helping users reduce hassle, save time, reduce slippage losses, and have no additional fees.</p><p><br></p><h2>Project promotion (Contract completed - contract will be open source)</h2><p>Due to the loss of eos ecological users, the project party on eos cannot be well promoted, so OBSwap has developed a promotion plan that can increase the enthusiasm of users to participate, increase the willingness of users to share, and improve the advertising effect of the project party.</p><p><br></p><h2>Token Recycle(Published)</h2><p>Every account on eos has more or less received a useless airdrop and garbage tokens, resulting in chaotic asset display data. In this regard, OBSwap has provided a recycling function of garbage tokens, which is convenient for users to use them without consuming them. In the case of memory, useless garbage tokens are cleaned up, and the user has a clean and concise eos account.</p><p><br></p><h2>Cross-chain bridge (In progress - contract will be open source)</h2><p>The original intention of OBSwap is to introduce mainstream currency assets from other chains into the EOS ecosystem. At present, most public chains and cross-chains are compatible with the evm model. In the first time, we will develop according to the evm progress of eos, launch the cross-chain solution that supports eos, and introduce more abundant mainstream token assets into the eos ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>Contact me in Telegram: @defiob or in https://t.me/defiob</p>",

"description": "<p>There are several projects which enable a bridge between EOS and Ethereum-based blockchains. Unfortunately they have many issues regarding cost, security, reliability and convenience.</p><p>We started with a known open source bridge that fits our needs the best and is already running by several applications. While checking every single line of code, we rewrote large parts of it and added many features. The result is a bridge which:</p><ul><li>runs by a fraction of the running costs and has options to fund itself</li><li>has increased security and reliability</li><li>works without a separate handling token</li><li>can be immediately used with your custom token (i.e. it does not need to be unlocked by a third party)</li><li>sends status messages via Telegram</li><li>has automatic resource management</li><li>provides a standard to share the user interface for EOS based tokens. Therefore, you do not have to provide your own interface.</li><li>several other features, see <a href=\"https://github.com/SavAct/eosioteleport\" rel=\"nofollow\">our GitHub</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Current development</strong></p><p>The development succeeded in two steps. The first step is a version that is backwards compatible to let already existing bridges benefit from many of the enhancements. The second step is an even further developed bridge which needs breaking changes. </p><p>The second version is a finished product which is fully tested and already in use by the SavAct token for a bridge between the EOS chain and BSC. Therefore, we recommend the second version.</p><p>The technical enhancements of the first and second step can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/SavAct/eosioteleport\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/SavAct/eosioteleport</a></p><p>The following video shows the usage of this running bridge in both directions. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBZ93UDjRYs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBZ93UDjRYs</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>License and future development</strong></p><p>The oracles and the EOS and ETH contracts of the bridge are published under the MIT license. That means they are open source and free to use. Therefore, you can immediately create a custom bridge for your token. To make it even more convenient, we provide a user interface that can manage each of these custom bridges.</p><p>This user interface is currently closed software. We want to develop some extras, clean up the code and also publish it as open source software. Furthermore, it is planned to extend the documentation to make it easier to run a token bridge on your own and how to incorporate it into the user interface.</p><p>If you are interested in this bridge and have problems setting it up, feel free to contact us for support.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Differentiation from the other projects of SavAct</strong></p><p>SavAct is a project with several open source projects. The biggest project is a fee-less decentralized fraud protection which solves the oracle problem. Its underlying mechanism uses a custom token and is applied for patent to prevent copies by big tech companies. The patent and the token do not affect the project described here in any way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><p>We have been working for around 5 years on the projects of SavAct. In that time we gained a lot of experience and finished several projects to a usable state. Until now we have deployed the blockchain websites, the independent fraud protection, a blockchain based data logger for medical devices and a bridge between EOS and Ethereum-based blockchains. In the end, we developed a lot with EOS and now is the time to introduce our work to the EOS community.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to write us in the <a href=\"https://t.me/SavActGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\">official Telegram group</a> or follow our <a href=\"https://t.me/SavAct\" rel=\"nofollow\">Telegram news channel</a>.</p>",

There is no doubt that we are moving towards a multi-chain future, where each WEB3 user travels through different blockchains and dApps, having and managing multiple identities, multiple usernames, multiple sets of identity information, full of tedium and inconvenience and lacking a good experience.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>With EVMNS, you can ensure that one universal identity remains intact, not only for all applications, but for all blockchains. You will only have to manage one set of identities, such as your profile, Email, Twitter, Telegram, ETH address, EOS address, EVM address, etc. How wonderful it will be to be able to sync to all chains with one edit.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>EVMNS will also meet these needs: human readable and memorable WEB3 usernames, a more user-friendly experience in WEB3 world, decentralized super business cards, and personal decentralized WEB3 homepage/website.</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Team Experience</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3>The core members of EVMNS Labs are the first ecological participants of EOS, who experienced and witnessed the launch of EOS and are still deeply involved in the ecological construction.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>Team members have participated in several medium to large scale EOS projects before and after, and also developed ENS (Ethereum Name Service) related domain Exchange, domain bulk registry protocol, etc. We are not only EOS loyalists, but also ENS heavy players, with good understanding of DID domain naming system.</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Project Progress</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3>The project was officially launched and went live on September 15, 2023. (As of September 20, 2023, nearly 1500 domain names have been registered. )</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>In addition to the regular release of name service contracts, we have also introduced three marketing campaigns, including the invitation system, prize pool, and domain name airdrop (EOS Native users can receive a free .evm domain).</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Funds Allocation</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3>The funds raised will primarily be used for more marketing campaigns and the development of new features.

"summary": "The EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard is a technical and operational standard for building the underlying value of the digital metaverse and spiritual home from the bottom up through NFT.",
"description": "<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><p>·EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard is a technical document that builds the underlying value standard of NFT in Metaverse.</p><p>·Open source, provide detailed instructions for use, and continue to iterate.</p><p>·EOS community users can enter without barriers and can directly generate economic benefits.</p><p>·The standard will be promoted in the EOS community to help the EOS ecosystem to become more prosperous.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the value standard of EOS Metaverse NFT?</strong></p><p>Like mountains, deserts, grasslands, and cultivated land in the real world, although they all exist on the surface, their value is different for humans. This is especially true in the world of the metaverse. Anyone can write a string of code and claim that it is the soil that breeds the various ecology of the metaverse, but whether this soil has value or not, the digital economy bred by this soil Whether the carrier is valuable or not needs to be measured by an open, more efficient, and easier to reach consensus standard. The EOS Metaverse NFT value standard is to construct a technical standard for the underlying value of a digital metaverse and spiritual home.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Features of EOS Metaverse NFT Value Standard</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inclusiveness</strong></p><p>EOS has the genes to become the greatest public chain and has a very high inclusive value. Based on this NFT value standard, anyone in the world can obtain NFT at almost zero cost and no threshold, and enter the metaverse blockchain. The world, this will doom the infinite development attributes of NFT, as long as they are citizens of the earth, they will have the opportunity to permanently obtain their own private NFT assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>At present, most of the current metaverse NFTs, after the initial release, their attributes and values show a difference in attribute levels. This is very unfair to users who obtain NFTs at the same time or users who obtain NFTs later. It does not reflect the principle of fairness in EOS ecological value. So based on the Metaverse NFT value standard, the initially issued NFT is a valueless NFT. It requires users to invest, produce and create to dig out value. The value elements and value potential of each NFT will be the same in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Investment</strong></p><p>The NFT in Metaverse can only exert its value under economic activities. Since economic activities are involved, there will inevitably be investment activities. In the Metaverse NFT value standard, the Swap impermanent slippage mechanism, stable fund pool, and basic investment compensation guarantee mechanism will help investors share or reduce investment risks according to contract algorithms and standards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Productive</strong></p><p>NFT in the metaverse has the attributes of value development and production activities. NFT development and production activities mainly rely on the user&#39;s time and spiritual contribution in the metaverse world. In the Metaverse NFT value standard, the value of the user&#39;s time and the value of production activities will be defined, and from the mechanism, the user&#39;s labor efforts and rewards in the Metaverse will be fully guaranteed, and one labor will be rewarded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shareability</strong></p><p>NFTs in the Metaverse need to have the attributes of shared value. The Metaverse ecology is a co-construction and shared ecology, and the shared value of NFTs should not be controlled by market capital, but generated through a consensus algorithm mechanism. Users&#39; time and labor efforts in the Metaverse will help to enhance the shared value of NFTs, in which capital does not play a decisive role, and NFTs or holding groups with higher shared values will surely obtain more lasting and higher returns. .<strong>Liquidity</strong></p><p>The circulation of economic value of Metaverse is a very important link, and it is the fundamental guarantee that economic activities can continue to be active. The Metaverse NFT value standard sets out the attributes of NFT transfer and transaction. At the same time, it also has the standard for optional asset package transfer. The owner can choose to package any digital assets together to participate for liquied.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>scalability</strong></p><p>In addition to expanding its own ecological application scenarios, the development of the Metaverse NFT ecosystem is mainly to expand the creation of other more valuable NFTs. With this basic Metaverse NFT standard, the ecosystem will be open to attract more Metaverse application scenarios. Enter the metaverse world with more valuable NFTs and share the future economic value of NFTs.</p><p>With the establishment of such a NFT value standard, the EOS public chain has the lowest threshold and the highest efficiency. Low threshold and high efficiency are the most basic conditions for attracting the participation of hundreds of millions of grassroots civilians. From the perspective of the performance of the public chain, with the characteristics of high TPS, low transaction fees, and instant transactions, EOS is more suitable for the development of the metaverse ecology and is more suitable for the operation of the metaverse digital economy than ETH and other public chains. It is said that EOS will be the most suitable soil and environment for the development of the metaverse ecology, and only the EOS public chain can meet the promotion and implementation of the metaverse NFT value standard.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What did we do</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Work completed in the first fundraising stage:</p><p>1. For the first time in the EOS ecosystem, we put forward the standard concept of the private domain of the metaverse, so that everyone in the world can completely independently own a piece of private land that truly belongs to themselves in the metaverse.</p><p>2. Established and improved the algorithmic stability mechanism of SWAP transactions, completed the development of the Swap contract, optimized the defects of the existing algorithmic stability model in the market by improving the mechanism, and helped by algorithmic mechanisms such as irregular slippage, stable pool, and bonus pool. Investors share or reduce investment risks and minimize the impact of capital affecting market prices in a relatively concentrated time period.</p><p>3. Completed the contract development of NFT farms and distributed NFT mining, and established the world&#39;s first distributed NFT mining standard model. Each mining pool differentiates the APY rate of return of the mining pool according to the size of its NFT shared value . Through the algorithm mechanism of NFT shared value, more users and players can be shared, so that players and users who provide more shared value to the community can obtain more lasting and higher returns, while forcing players with poor consensus. And users turn to a virtuous economic cycle on the road.</p><p>4. Completed the development of the first trading market for packaging NFT assets on the EOS test chain. This is a brand new attempt to integrate NFT and digital assets and participate in the transaction process.</p><p>5. The first swap contract developed according to the NFT value standard has been open sourced. The swap contract code has been submitted to BEOSIN for audit in mid-March 2022, and the audit report is expected to be completed by the end of March.</p><p><br></p><p>Work completed in the second fundraising stage:</p><p>1. The swap smart contract we developed according to the NFT value standard has passed the audit of BEOSIN on March 24, 2022. The address of the audit report:</p><p>https://beosin.com/hermit/back/website/common/preview/single? fileUuid=e677f8826eec4bec2f3673885519d143oeNbkZtek9D&amp;reportNum=202203241332</p><p>2. We launched the first decentralized NFT value standard private domain portal community website in the EOS ecosystem. All EOS ecosystem users can freely participate in the content construction of the community private domain portal, revision of NFT value standards, participation in public discussions and discussions in the community. </p><p>3. We completed the development of the first version of the NFT distributed shared farm in May 2022. After more than a month of data testing on the EOS main chain, the trial operation was officially opened on July 13, 2022, and it has initially formed The market atmosphere of differentiated APY yield farms. Through the data of the core contract of the project on EOS Authority, the overall market user activity and quality have achieved preliminary results.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/21fddefd-df58-448f-8816-1e9067e7d4df.png\"></p><p>EOS Authority contract query: https://eosauthority.com/account/ylecorecodes?network=eos</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Future Outlook</strong></p><p>1. According to the concept of creating a private domain of the Metaverse, in addition to starting to open source the relevant contract codes involved in this standard step by step, we also plan to start a standard plan for the complete decentralization of the NFT project, using a “Decentralized domain name &amp; Decentralized project + Decentralized storage ” model to makes it convenient for any user in the world to quickly and easily build their own decentralized private domain platform, and truly realize the decentralization of projects.</p><p>2. In the 2nd-3rd quarter of 2022, we will continue and improve NFT cultivation and production standards, distributed NFT mining standards and packaging NFT transaction standards, and open source code, and the related contract code will also further complete the audit-related work;</p><p>3. Based on the NFT value standard, we will further integrate the CryptoTree NFT developed by our team (a Dapp that has been running on the TRON public chain in September 2019, and has been selected into the top three encrypted collections in the world on Dappradar and Dapp.com) Category DAPP) projects are migrated to the EOS ecosystem and serve as an application demonstration of the Metaverse NFT value standard.</p><p>4. Continue to unite all EOS community developers and users to jointly maintain and upgrade the metaverse NFT value standard, making it a real universal standard in the EOS ecosystem as soon as possible.</p>",

"description": "<h2>NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA)</h2><h3> </h3><h2>Introduction:</h2><h3>Hello everyone, my name is Shu Fan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT\" rel=\"nofollow\">an original NFT artist</a>. I have <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">published works</a> on EOS for more than a year, and I am also a <a href=\"https://genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org/members/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">member of Eden on EOS</a>. I plan to combine my creative experience and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCptl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden Capital</a>&#39;s expertise to jointly launch the NFT standard for traditional painting artworks on EOS in my name. Different from other NFTs, traditional painting works of art have their own unique characteristics, and it is necessary to establish exclusive NFT standards to better display their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>In the last season, this project received 35 donations totaling 49 EOS and the corresponding Pomelo funding match. We would like to express our gratitude to the EOS community. In recent months after Season 2, we have made many explorations on the development and cooperative application of NFT standards for traditional painting artworks. Finally, based on the characteristics of EOS and the <a href=\"https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract/wiki/Structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT standards of Atomichub</a>, we have explored a relatively simple and feasible traditional painting method. The NFT standard has been publicly published on Medium, &#34;<a href=\"https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works on EOS blockchain</a>&#34;(NS-TPA).</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The first application demonstration work - <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/template/shufan.free/6787\" rel=\"nofollow\">Found a treasure on the way home</a>, was also published using this standard, and appropriate promotion was carried out. I will publish more traditional art works based on this standard, and will continue to maintain, optimize and promote this standard on EOS. Hope you all continue to support, thank you!</h3><p><br></p><h2>Details:</h2><h3><strong>1. The changes that NFT brings to traditional painting artists.</strong> NFT, giving traditional painting artists a new platform for displaying and sharing their works, is also an epoch-making revolution for the future traditional painting art market. I am excited to be in such an era. Since I <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/asset/2199023263895\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold my first work</a> on eos.atomichub.io on April 8, 2021, <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/profile/shufan.free#sellHistory\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 160 works have been sold</a> in total, sales increased by more than 100 works compared with the previous season. The originals of each work are hand-painted originals with heart, including procreate originals , Paper hand-painted original. Let me feel the value transfer charm that NFT brings to works of art.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>2. Early explorers of NFTs in traditional painting and art works.</strong> From the market point of view, there are currently only 93 NFT collections on <a href=\"eos.atomichub.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">eos.atomichub.io</a>, but the vast majority of them are Gamefi; and my 4 collections are the rare ones, which are based on traditional paintings art works. Therefore, from this point of view, I could be regarded as one of the early explorers and leaders in the transformation and extension of traditional painting art works in the direction of NFT. At the same time, the experience of the past one year has also made me feel that the current NFT standards and forms have many restrictions on traditional painting works of art.</h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSBZ8sF3gx6NZcZ9fgqkyHHR8mVBmejixDkGpdot8xLTo\"></h3><h4>ShuFan&#39;s 4 collections</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>3. Traditional paintings and artworks have their own characteristics.</strong> The Gamefi NFT standard that is dominant in the existing market is not very suitable for traditional painting art NFTs, because Gamefi&#39;s NFTs generally have the characteristics of unlimited or huge Mints, strong correlation between NFTs, and relatively low creation costs. It highlights the playability value of the game. Traditional painting art works NFTs are different , under normal circumstances, it has a small circulation (even only 1 Mint), high originality requirements, relatively independent between NFT, relatively high creation cost, and paper-based physical manuscripts can be mailed to collectors It highlights the viewing value, scarcity and collection value of art works, and has a higher demand for protection of brands, art copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Therefore, there should be a set of NFT standards that are more specific to traditional painting works of art to better demonstrate their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>4. The market potential of traditional painting art works is huge.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-expensive-artworks-sold-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">most expensive work</a> of art worth over $100 million in 2021, at $103,410,000, is Picasso&#39;s Femme assise près d&#39;une fenêtre (1932); moreover, according to <a href=\"https://www.masterworks.io/?utm_source=google+sem&amp;utm_medium=platform&amp;utm_campaign=art_invest-in-art_canada&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5-WRBhCKARIsAAId9Fm5DMVPE3LER8tN7d_dFjEVPKyFIXwoSdOjXEV8-nqnwDbepQDk2KcaAp0AEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" rel=\"nofollow\">the masterworks report</a>, In 2020, the global painting transaction value has exceeded 50 billion US dollars, the transaction volume has exceeded 30 million, and the market potential is huge. With the empowerment of NFT, the market potential of traditional paintings and artworks will be further stimulated.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaYBTAaw4AuMum5wzfMCzeAYfp7DMEW7Ep2sw9GfMswg3\"></h3><h4>Global Painting Market Value and Transaction Volume 2009-2020</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>5. EOS needs a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting art works.</strong> EOS is a well-known public chain whose ecology is re-prospering. Its excellent blockchain design (fast speed, low transaction cost, customized account names, etc.) is very suitable for the development of NFT. However, on Atomichub, compared to <a href=\"https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">WAX</a>, the issuance, trading volume, and trading value of the <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT market on EOS</a> can only be considered as an early stage. However, it is foreseeable that in the near future, more traditional painting works of art will be transformed into NFTs. It is necessary and urgent to establish a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting and art works in EOS to carry this huge potential market.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>6. The funds raised will be used for:</strong></h3><h3>1. Support to update this standard to be more beautified, complete, and easier to use for users.</h3><h3>2. Cooperate with existing NFT platforms, art galleries, to attract more artists to adopt this standard.</h3><h3>3. Promote the NFT standard of traditional painting artworks. If we get enough grants, we&#39;ll create a new independent website focusing on NFT of traditional paintings and invite artists to join, etc.</h3>",

Users can access a rating system and voting portal, making it easier for token holders to make an informed decision. EOS Rate then gathers ratings to help capture a global collective opinion, or &#34;wisdom of the crowd,&#34; and measure if voting patterns truly reflect voter sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Why Is EOS Rate Important?</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Users can rate BPs based on five categories: transparency, infrastructure, trustiness, community, and development. As of now, a total of 533 ratings have been submitted, from which, 72 block producers have been rated by Eden members and 52 BPs have been rated by non-Eden members. It has been recognized as a relevant tool to promote transparency and accountability in the EOS Mainnet and Eden. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>What Comes Next?</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>So far, most of the project development has been sponsored by the EOS Costa Rica team with support from ​​individual contributors. Now, we want to fund the continued development of our backlog and general maintenance of the dApp, including new features such as airdropping tokens for users who submit ratings, generating reports, overall front-end facelift, and marketing efforts.

Project Introduction</h2><p><br></p><p>The DreamRealNotes DApp, a completely decentralized Web3.0 social media platform. Articles, replies, pictures, videos, audios and other data published by users can be permanently stored and exist forever.</p><p><br></p><p>Users can publish articles, replies, pictures, videos, audios, etc. of any length in this DApp system.</p><p><br></p><p>The above types of content posted by users automatically become a different NFT.</p><p><br></p><p>This DApp system has social functions similar to Twitter. Users can post articles, post replies, forward articles, create personal profiles, follow other users, like, give rewards, and so on.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Implemented features and next steps</h2><p><br></p><p>The main functions that this DApp system has implemented so far are:</p><p>(1) Users can post articles, replies, pictures, videos, and audios.</p><p>(2) Users can create profiles.</p><p>(3) Users can follow other users or unfollow them, view articles published by following users, and so on.</p><p><br></p><p>The main functions that will be implemented in the next step are as follows (Q3 and Q4 2022) :</p><p>(1) Realize the function of liking and rewarding articles and replies.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Use environment requirements</h2><p><br></p><p>This DApp system needs to use the three blockchains of ETH, Arweave, and EOS at the same time. Among them, ETH and Arweave are responsible for storing the content data of articles, pictures, videos, and audios, and the EOS smart contract is responsible for storing their catalog and index data.</p><p><br></p><p>When using the mobile wallet App to access this DApp system, you can only perform browsing and viewing operations, and cannot perform other operations. Because the existing mobile wallet App does not support operations on multiple blockchains at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to use the full functionality of this DApp system, it is recommended to use a personal computer, Google Chrome, MetaMask plug-in wallet, ArConnect plug-in wallet, and Scatter desktop wallet.</p><p><br></p><h2>5.

We want to spread ideas of how our global society can better organize itself in a decentralized manner for the benefit of all. We intend to do this by building a comprehensive training/education portal that will be free to use and will cover the following general topics:</p><ul><li><strong>Fractal Democracy</strong> <em>(i.e. “True Democracy” via Eden on EOS as outlined in Daniel Larimer’s book More Equal Animals)</em></li><li><strong>Holacracy</strong> <em>(removing the need for hierarchical control structures of traditional organizations)</em></li><li><strong>Decentralized Blockchain Technology </strong><em>(promoting censorship resistance and a society with equal access to products and services via blockchain)</em></li></ul><p> </p><p>The target markets for the various training materials will be:</p><ul><li>Local Communities</li><li>Grades 3-8</li><li>Grades 9-12</li><li>Post-Secondary School</li><li>Homeschooling Households</li></ul><p> </p><h2><strong>Use of Funds</strong></h2><p>All funds raised thus far have been accumulating in the EOS account <a href=\"https://www.bloks.io/account/antifragiled\" rel=\"nofollow\">antifragiled</a>.

It is expected that funds will now be deliberately put to work and for our next season of Pomelo there will be a clear use of funds and a tangible result. Those will be clearly presented with links to transactions and memos.</p><p><br></p><p>The primary contributors to this initiative have been consistent and dedicated.

In the future will also have application specific integrations for advanced IBC use cases.</p><p><br></p><h2>Progress</h2><p>Our team has recently taken several steps to improve the stability and performance of our connection to the EOS chain for IBC transactions. First, we deployed new EOS P2P and API nodes to better support this functionality. Additionally, we have a deployed an IBC Server for both EOS and Telos, including the installation of a local Firehose endpoint on EOS. To make IBC transfers more accessible, we also launched a simple UI at https://ibc.animus.is.</p><p><br></p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Looking ahead, we are working to deploy new smart contracts for KROWN, BOID, and BBT tokens to take advantage of our new IBC bridge, and we have already begun preparing for WAX IBC endpoint deployment. We are also starting development of a friendly UI which will make interacting with IBC primitives easy and intuitive. Finally, we have ordered new hardware to increase our storage capacity and support our growing network requirements.</p><p><br></p><h2>Public Good?</h2><p>All code funded by this proposal will be open sourced. The API services we currently operate and user interfaces (for interacting with the contracts) will be hosted and maintained as a free service as long as this proposal is sufficiently funded.</p><p><br></p><h2>Join Us!</h2><p>We have a fresh group on Telegram!</p><p>https://t.me/antelopex</p>",

"summary": "A new tool for managing and optimizing DAO governance is proposed.",
"description": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p><br></p><p>The emergence of decentralized systems of value transfer has brought the natural need for decentralized governance protocols. In this regard, Several experiments are being conducted within the EOS/Antelope ecosystem. EdenOnEos, Eden-Fractal, the Spanish Speaking Fractal and the Alien Worlds Fractal are prominent examples of these experiments. In order to truly be effective and gain increased acceptance, all of these initiatives (and any decentralized governance project for that matter) have to overcome several challenges: On the one hand, there is an inherent difficulty in determining the optimum path. This difficulty is augmented by the extreme diversity of opinions, contrasting individual priorities, lack of powerful tools of data visualization, ineffectual methods for conveying new ideas to the incumbent community, among other factors. On the other hand, the sheer amount of information coupled with the inefficiency of the data transmission channels make for a really noisy and slow environment. </p><p><br></p><p>According to Systems Science, the way Complex Systems manage to thrive amid noisy environments is through self-regulation via feedback loops. This is true for biological systems at all scales: from genetic circuits to entire ecosystems; but also for financial systems, climate systems, electrical and transportation grids and, ultimately, the entire universe. Equilibrium is achieved via efficient interactions; these interactions frequently emerge into feedback mechanisms. The more efficient the mechanisms, the more adaptable and robust the corresponding system is, be it a cell, a community, a market or a transportation grid. </p><p><br></p><h1>Simulation</h1><p><br></p><p>The purpose of this grant for Season 6 is to characterize, design and implement a computer simulation for the governance protocol of these DAOs. This is a follow up of the proposal I made in season 3 which intended to build feedback technologies for decentralized communities. The grant is part of a long term vision that looks for better self-organization, self-management, adaptability, resilience and robustness of decentralized community projects. Because the initial financing will come from the EOS ecosystem, it will be natural that the EOSIO network will initially benefit the most from this endeavor. However, the need for this kind of technologies extends throughout and beyond the decentralized cryptospace.</p><p><br></p><p>The motivation for developing such a simulation becomes apparent if this tool allow us to: </p><ol><li>Identify and design techniques for measuring community behavior. </li><li>Identify and design techniques for more effectively transferring information within the system.</li><li>Identify and design techniques for aligning incentives so as to reduce noise, increase participation, etc.</li><li>Identify and design techniques that allow each independent member to measure his impact within the community.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>The initial tentative approach to developing the aforementioned simulation is as described in <a href=\"https://hive.blog/hive-167922/@aguerrido/towards-a-statistical-simulation-of-fractal-democracy\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> I did for Season 3. The selected language will be either python or R.</p><p><br></p><p>Being a public project, all work, including code repositories, technical documentation will be free and open sourced under the adequate IP licenses. </p><p><br></p><p>With all sincerity and pure heart,</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Jorge Ramos</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4><br></h4>",

Yet, the network still has not rewarded this unwavering support with more content.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>NFTs and gaming has proven to be a powerful and successful combination across many other chains. EOS was not isolated from the NFT world — the AtomicAssets standard has already enabled a handful of content creators to issue, sell and reward their communities with artwork and collectibles. There is already an undeniable growth in quality and utility of EOS NFTs, with collections like Zombie Art, Pomelo, Animals EOSIO and the likes choosing this chain. However, the traction NFTs have on EOS doesn’t come close to what we see on WAX — a network built on the same technology using the same AtomicAssets standard. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>EOS is part of Wombats DNA, and we want to see this space thrive. That’s why we’ve built Dungeon Master to give gamers more content and to incentivize other creators to bring their amazing projects to EOS. Content creators are instrumental for the success of any chain, which is why our commitment to empowering them goes beyond making their NFTs stakeable. It means additional exposure, collaboration and adding over 10,000 people to their collectors ranks.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Since we started in December 2021, Dungeon Master has seen 100,000 NFTs staked on WAX and over 150,000 NFTs staked on EOS — by more than 50,000 unique players. These numbers alone are a testament to the fact that there is a vast community out there that is highly receptive to diverse high-quality content. We want to see more of it as well. At the same time, we’d love to be able to add more features to make our multi-chain staking game even more entertaining for our players. By allowing vetted NFT collections to be staked in Dungeon Master, we’ve already been providing additional utility to those NFTs. We have already fulfilled many intriguing concepts, and with your help, we will be able to deliver even more! </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Interested creators can already reach out to us here:</span></p><p><a href=\"https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dungeon.wombat.app/apply</a></p><p><br></p><h3><span>Our plans</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span>Back our pledges so we can keep making Dungeon Master a better game and venue for the creators. We will keep adding NFT collections for staking over the next seasons — or assist with launching one to give them more exposure even before they can be used. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Your backing will help us achieve the following milestones:</span></p><ul><li><span>Adding partner NFTs as rewards to the daily chests</span></li><li><span>Clans</span></li><li><span>Multiple Wombats as NFTs</span></li><li><span>Multiple Dungeons</span></li><li><span>Leaderboards</span></li><li><span>Name tags</span></li><li><span>Land</span></li><li><span>Season passes</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span>And many more.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>We hope that you would love to see all these changes in Dungeon Master too and that you will get behind our goals! &lt;3</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Dungeon Master</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span>Dungeon Master is a multi-chain staking game with thousands of active players and tons of awesome NFT collections to stake for loot!

"description": "<p>Project Overview</p><p>This grant proposal stems from the EVMxIdeathon on 14 Nov 2022 with the winning submission for the Web3 category: <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/small-business-accounting-web3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Business Accounting &amp; Web3</a>. <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZpWqqgaRDN7I5hinlSYHFh5_sBAna-52\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video of Ideathon final ceremony web3 winning entry.</a></p><p><br></p><p>This grant provides funding for the development and release of the framework to sync EOS blockchain with QuickBooks Online. Approval of this grant will give access to EOS blockchain to small businesses that are already using QuickBooks and be used standalone to capture blockchain information for accounting purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Overview</p><p>Name: Small Business Accounting &amp; Web3</p><p>Brief Description: Create a framework and syncing solution between EOS blockchain and accounting solutions like QuickBooks and QuickBooks online.</p><p>Relationship to EOSIO: Links Partner (customers, vendors, and employees) to their EOS accounts by syncing these from QuickBooks online (QBO). This will allow the system to track payments sent and received on EOS blockchain into QBO for accounting purposes.</p><p>Reason for Interest: Our sister company, High5Software, has been providing small business solutions that sync to QB for two decades and achieved the highest QB Gold Partner for syncing QB and SME: Service Management Enterprise. Leveraging this expertise will allow us to build a sync platform between EOS blockchain and QBO to provide accurate accounting using the typical base currency of USD. Using price oracles, accurate accounting can be captured into QBO for use for sales tax, income tax and other general accounting practices. This solution will also give small businesses an inexpensive way to receive EOS payments on invoices as well as pay vendors and employees.</p><p>Project Details</p><p>A. Framework: Multi-tenant software framework to enable Web3, EOS modules that sync with QUickBooks Online (QBO) and capability to sync with QB and other accounting solutions.</p><p>B. Partner Accounts: Configure EOS account for all the partners that work with EOS/Web3 including Customers, Vendors/Suppliers/Subcontractors, Employees and the company using the system</p><p>C. tipit Pay: Secure online payment system that can allow EOS payments in addition to traditional Credit Card and ACH payments using various processors. tipit Pay links are added to invoices and emails of invoices. Example: <a href=\"https://pay.tipit.io/home?platform=tipitpayrequest&amp;to=gilsertience&amp;amount=1000&amp;symbol=GIL&amp;contract=gilsertience&amp;memo=But%20why%20not%20tho&amp;precision=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">tipit pay link</a></p><p>D. Web3 Monitoring: Monitor company and partner accounts for transactions that should be captured into the accounting system. This includes payments received into specific EOS accounts, for example receiving Pomelo grant funds and getting invoice payments from customers and sending payments to vendors and employees.</p><p>E. QBO Sync: Sync all transactions to and from EOS blockchain into QBO.</p><p>F. Pricing Oracle: Capture token prices at the time of the transaction for accurate accounting into QBO. For example, if 5 EOS is received from a Pomelo grant at multiple different times, the system will accurately price those transactions into the base currency, typically USD.</p><p><br></p><p>Ecosystem Fit</p><p>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Most teams within the EOS ecosystem are considered &#34;small businesses&#34; and can use this system to accurately handle their accounting for sales tax, income tax and other accounting purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is your target audience? All small businesses and independant contractors that are working with EOS for receiving and sending payments. Also targeted to companies using QBO.</p><p><br></p><p>What need(s) does your project meet? Accurate accounting solution using the most popular small biz accounting system, QuickBooks Online while utilizing EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? There are no solutions known for EOS. There are three solutions on the QBO marketplace that work with other blockchains but none that work with EOS or Antelope chains. FIO blockchain has some related elements such as tracking partner accounts across other blockchains and an invoicing solution, however no QBO syncing is available as far as we know. FIO could possibly be a partner of this solution to allow payment handling on other blockchains such as BTC and ETH however investigation is outside the scope of this grant.</p><p><br></p><p>This grant application is also being submitted to ENF. Please support this pomelo grant to show your support for this project.</p><p><br></p><p>Public Good: Everyone will be given a free system for a limited number of partners. This will allow groups with Pomelo grant owners to utilize the system to track all grants into QuickBooks Online and independent contractors to utilize the system to be paid or send payments. In addition, by providing a system such as this, it will grow the EOS ecosystem the more small businesses that exchange EOS based tokens.</p>",

"description": "<p><strong>Up Vote Bot</strong> is a Telegram companion bot that helps lead Eden (and its forks) through up vote election process and beyond.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Bot increases retention for Eden elections.</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Bot will send you a notification on Telegram 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, 2 days, and 25h prior to the election time, if your participation status remains negative.</p><p>Once your election status shifts to participating, the bot will switch to notify you 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, and at 0 hours, to keep you in the loop and try to ensure members don&#39;t turn into a no-show. This will further increase retention.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Bot leads you through elections.</strong></h3><p>If your election status is participating, the bot will send you an invite link to a breakout room that Eden smart contracts randomly selected for you. Once you join your breakout room with other Eden members, Bot invites you to join the group video chat, and reminds you to click record. Telegram recording is easier, and the video waits for you in the saved folder (cloud storage) for later upload to IPFS. Bot reminds you again at 10 and later 5 minutes left, with a link to Eden portal, followed by an emergency link for bloks.io voting action.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Bot removes Zoom dependencies.</strong></h3><p>Zoom has questionable practices for encryption (rough edges of video streams still seen), and is dependent on servers in China with questionable freedom of speech records, which adds unnecessary risk. In addition, people are confused about the Zoom link creation and its sharing steps currently implemented in Eden. How to give other users rights to record in a short time is another UX pain point, and there are also bugs where nobody is the host, so recording couldn&#39;t be started. Telegram video chat mitigates all of this and it&#39;s easy to join, use, record, and save recordings automatically to its cloud (under Saved Messages).</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to reducing the friction for non-experienced members, the code itself removes Zoom app dependencies, which makes Eden members portal passwords unnecessary too. This reduces the existing Eden web portal code complexity.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Bot can save the day.</strong></h3><p>Bot acts as an alternative UI portal, aiding people to vote on-chain if the web portal is down or too slow (like it was in season 3 elections).</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Bot is a public good</strong></h3><p>All components of the solution are <a href=\"https://github.com/ZeroPass/Up-Vote-Bot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fully open-sourced</a>, and documentation will be provided for people to deploy.</p><p>We are also running <a href=\"https://t.me/Up_Vote_Bot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Telegram instance</a> so Eden can depend on it. If people don&#39;t like us, they can redeploy. The same is true for other Edens/Fractals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Basic components:</strong></h3><ul><li>Telegram Bot</li><li>Telegram UserBot</li><li>Dockerized business logic, talking with dfuse for on-chain data, Telegram API for both bots, and database</li><li>PostgreSQL database to make sure server bug/reset doesn&#39;t disrupt the steps that were not yet completed, adding resilience.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Season goals</strong></h3><p>The goal is to stabilize/test the new functionality, fix the issues and write functionality that will be deemed missing, and overall maintain the open-source codebase so it can reliably support the elections anywhere.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Future goals</strong></h3><ul><li>We will need to cover the costs of maintaining, running, fixing bugs, and monitoring it for 4 elections per year, plus adding small features and improvements. That will presumably cost us another $10.000 per year.</li><li>The Bot can in theory cover all Edens, Fractals, and Hypha DAOs using the process, and it can become multilingual. It depends on the community pull, and funding provided.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We will use all potential funds over the actual cost of delivery to build EOS-related projects. All work financed by Pomelo will be open-sourced as a matter of principle.</p>",

"description": "<h2>Overview:</h2><h3>Art is essential in any era, and blockchain has brought many potential transformations to traditional painting art. The ShuFan NFT team has released two projects on Pomelo: the &#34;<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/shufannft\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShuFan NFT Art</a>&#34; project and the &#34;<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA)</a>&#34; project. With the support of the EOS community, we have made visible efforts to promote the value of EOS and invite more artists to join the EOS NFT ecosystem, resulting in some ongoing achievements. This season, we are excited to join Pomelo on Telos and expand these efforts to the Telos blockchain, creating &#34;Artwork NFT on Telos.&#34;</h3><p><br></p><h2>What do we bring to Telos specifically?</h2><h3>1.ShuFan NFT Art will bring more exquisite illustration artworks to the Telos ecosystem, spreading the values of Telos through the form of illustration art. We will support more Telos ecosystem projects through art donations and promote the advantages of NFTs on Telos.</h3><h3>For example, we have already launched an NFT gifting campaign on Telos. The artwork is called &#34;Antelope&#34; NFT. This beautiful artwork is being cross-chain released from EOS to Telos for the first time, and it will be gifted to projects developed on Telos. It can be used for project promotion on Telos and contribute to the development of the Telos ecosystem. After researching NFT platforms on Telos, we found that the most active one is <a href=\"https://kitchenft.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kitchenft.io</a>. It is an NFT platform based on Telos EVM and is similar in form to Opensea. We will distribute our artwork on this platform.</h3><p><br></p><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/2aff9415-a3bf-4d25-a75a-ed20d4656b7d.png\">2.We will attempt to promote the NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA) in the Telos ecosystem. Leveraging Telos&#39; excellent NFT performance and the immense market potential of art, we aim to better showcase the originality and collectible value of traditional painting artworks while protecting the artistic copyrights of artists and collectors.</h3><p><br></p><h2>Our Plans:</h2><h3>Your support will help us achieve the following plans:</h3><h3>1. Promote the advantages of NFTs on Telos. Continue promoting the advantages of NFTs on Telos through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT\" rel=\"nofollow\">our Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/shufanfree\" rel=\"nofollow\">other public media</a>, accessible to everyone for free. We believe this will help attract more artists, NFT enthusiasts, and art collectors to join the NFT ecosystem on Telos. &#34;<a href=\"https://nftdrop.carrd.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Art NFTs for TELOS community projects (Season 1)</a>&#34; is ongoing.</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/c3e8327e-cb2e-42a0-a2f2-9acb976e9129.jpg\" width=\"301\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/02cbfce0-5832-45db-8c56-329d9ee96961.jpg\" width=\"420\"></p><h3>2. Attempt to promote the use of NS-TPA on Telos, including updating the standard for traditional painting NFTs on Telos to make it more refined and user-friendly. We will also promote and support more artists in adopting this standard to publish their artworks on Telos.</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f1a0f3e5-fbb9-41d0-a026-b171ea9d3170.jpg\"></h3><p><br></p><h2><strong>About ShuFan NFTs:</strong></h2><h3>ShuFan NFT was created by freelance illustrator ShuFan.

His eye-opening book empowers readers with information and wisdom and demonstrates a path out of despair!</p><p> </p><p>Dan’s book provided readers with the necessary spark to break free from their shells and take action, turning them from passive to active. This is the reason I think it needs to be read (or heard) by more people. MEA, in my opinion, is excellent in this sense. People must realise it’s time to wake up and take responsibility for their role in the modern world. It’s the primary reason that I, and members of the German EOS Community translated it in the first place.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why an Audiobook?</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Many time-constrained individuals opt to listen to podcasts and audiobooks as an adjunct to reading. I choose this format for this reason. Chuck MacDonald&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xepUoQbOzr4&amp;ab_channel=MarkScheer-earthman\" rel=\"nofollow\">English audiobook of More Equal Animals</a> has thousands of <em>views</em> on YouTube. I&#39;m hoping that the German-speaking community will enjoy this audiobook as well.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Format</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Because some people like listening to audiobooks and podcasts while travelling to work or while preparing dinner at home, this audiobook will be made available for free on YouTube and other podcasting platforms in a playlist of brief episodes (max 10 minutes each).</p><p><br></p><h4><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71o8359li0s&amp;list=PLf_xIvPM3ermdpmePabPbwls96YCkqg2r&amp;ab_channel=MarkusHinrichs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit the project’s Youtube channel to listen to the first episodes</a></h4><h4><br></h4><p>The entire audiobook will be available for free download and listening as soon as its ready..</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Status, timeframe and financing</strong></h2><p> </p><p>I began this project in June 2022, and now attempt to record new material as time permits. I want people to enjoy listening to this audiobook.It’s difficult to estimate, but I believe that recording, editing, and platform preparation will require roughly 50-80 working hours. (I didn&#39;t include mastering since I would hire a professional audio studio when there&#39;s enough funding.) My dear friend and EDEN member Lukas Mantinger (@sagarmathanp), who initially funded the translation project of More Equal Animals into German (<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/moegerman\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomelo.io/grants/moegerman</a>), pre-funded this project with 600 EOS.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Giving to this project supports the fractal democratic process as a public good for increasing participation across on EOS, the greater community and individual empowerment. There is a great deal of opportunity since there are more than 170 million native German speakers worldwide.</p><p> </p><p>Here is a link to the first 5 episodes of this project on my YouTube channel.

Investors who would like to get exposure to the best projects on EOS can do so by simply owning one token. </p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/b223f547-9aa1-4e3b-a617-14ac6dc92f9a.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://eosetf.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eosetf.io</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Vision</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Through our solution it will be possible to set up an on-chain investment fund in minutes. Think of it as a fund in a box. Similarly as with Medium the blogging platform, anybody can create their own blog. With CETF anybody can start their own fund. Each fund creator will be able to spin up their own landing page and web-app that investors could easily access. Thanks to the bridges, assets of other chains could be used in funds on EOS. Which means our asset management protocol has potential to bring a lot of liquidity to EOS.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution will feature the simplest UX. We’ll optimize for the investors to have as few clicks as possible so they could super easily invest and let the fund managers do the work.</p><p><br></p><p>Our on-chain asset management protocol eliminates counter-party risk because fund managers no longer have custody over the investments, instead all the assets stay in an immutable contract.</p><p>Protocol and the web-apps will be fully decentralized. Whole protocol will live on-chain and there will be option to deploy front-ends of each fund to IPFS. No regulation will apply to the protocol. The solution will be immortal. If some fund managers will like to adhere to the regulations they will be able to add modules to their front-ends.</p><p>The product will be decentralized in terms of development as well. It will be developed by DAO consisting of various DAOs. It will be possible to contribute anonymously. No government will be able to jail the developers.</p><p>At the core will be comprehensive tokenomics system. CETF token - the main utility token of the protocol will enable to claim fees that every single fund generates. There will be fixed inflation of CETF token, incentivizing fund managers, liquidity providers and marketers to join the protocol. System will be designed to fully capitalize on the network effects, rewarding highly early adopters and ensuring continuous rapid growth. Protocol will feature protocol owned liquidity and generation of real yield.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Short-term plan</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li>On-board additional fund managers to EOSETF.</li><li>Deploy WAXFUND to WAX mainnet.</li><li>Deploy TLOSFUND to Telos mainnet.</li><li>Audit of smart contracts.</li><li>Grow AUM in the funds.</li><li>Raise capital to bring the Vision to life.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Funding</strong></p><p><br></p><p>All the funding raised through Pomelo will be used to pay developers and cover the audit costs of smart contracts.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CETF13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://t.me/eosetf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Telegram</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eosetf.medium.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medium</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/fJwVFJEng3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></p>",

Blockchain and owning one’s own money have higher learning curves than traditional Internet use. Orienting the community with actionable information is a great way to get new users engaging in EOS Network chats. For veteran users, the extensive History and condensed Timeline offers a look back (for assurance) and a way to get quickly up to speed (for returning users).</p><p><br></p><h3>Developing a Solution</h3><p>Founded on original content, the History, Timeline, and other w3briefs products are inherently non-rivalrous and, at the very least, offer unique insight. The author/developer is a regular attendee of community meetings and networks with several members of the community. Both content and commentary target issues of the day. Thus, readers gain an understanding of events as they happen. </p><p>Also note, Google searches of EOS are notoriously unproductive. w3briefs.com is an independent history and encourages independent community media sources that support the ENF’s effort to inform the community.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Deliverable and Community Access</h3><p>The EOS Network lacks adequate information for orienting new users to daily conversations. Additionally, while some aspects of the History section may appear elsewhere (in various forms), nowhere is there a complete collection that’s searchable and chronologically maintained. </p><p>w3briefs.com already maintains some deliverables described. Free access has always been the way.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Focus, Timeline, and Budget</h3><p>Dvelopment timelines align with Pomelo seasons.</p><p><br></p><p>Why use w3briefs?

IPFS has been used during past Pomelo seasons. Blockchain integration and innovative applications remain strong considerations of all planning. As my skills and funding improve, I seek to venture beyond this project&#39;s more practical, assured solutions. </p><h3><br></h3><h3>About Me</h3><p>My name is Marco Gonzalez. I’m known throughout the community via meetings, elections, and various collaborations. There’s so much more I can give the community by leveraging the general and technical skills I’ve amassed over a lifetime. w3briefs focuses on adding value to the EOS Network and its leadership role in bringing web3 to the masses.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1><a href=\"https://w3briefs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit w3briefs.com</a></h1><p><br></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_wszChJc8I</p>[youtube]6_wszChJc8I[/youtube]<p><br></p>",

Unicove is also open-source, so if developers wanted to apply the same EVM bridge model to their own projects, they could do so.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who We Are: </strong>Greymass is an expert team of researchers and developers who have been with the EOS network since day 1, helping to launch the network with eos-voter (which later became Anchor). We’ve been contributing to the network as block producers and product developers ever since. Learn more about us at <a href=\"http://greymass.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://greymass.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why build an EVM bridge in Unicove?</h2><p><br></p><p>Right now, both the EOS and Telos networks have a fully functional EVMs. This is great, because it gives the network a chance to attract developers and innovative projects that can be built in Solidity, a more well-known smart contract language than Antelope’s C++. </p><p><br></p><p>But having the EVM is only half the battle. Now that it’s here, the network needs supporting infrastructure – tools that make it easier for both users and developers to engage with the EVM. We believe that easy-to-use EVM bridges (i.e., ways to swap Antelope-based tokens to EVM-based tokens) are a crucial part of this infrastructure, because they allow users to access tokens that they can use in EVM-based dApps. This bridge will serve as Unicove&#39;s first EVM-based feature as we continue to explore how best it can serve the Antelope ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>While the network currently has a free-standing bridge courtesy of the ENF, we want to lower the barrier to entry by putting an EVM bridge directly in our Unicove web wallet. This will give more users the opportunity to swap tokens, since all Unicove users will have direct access without having to leave their wallet.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why trust Greymass to build it?</h2><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>We have extensive experience building wallets for the EOS community.</strong> Our very first product for the network was a wallet, and we’ve kept the legacy going. Today, we offer two wallet products: the Anchor wallet (available for iOS, Android, and desktop!) and the Unicove web wallet. With the lessons we’ve learned along the way, we feel confident that we can deliver a user-friendly EVM bridge within the Unicove wallet.</li><li><strong>This isn’t our first rodeo. </strong>Feel free to look up our past Pomelo pitches – we’ve now participated in multiple Pomelo seasons, and every time, we’ve delivered on our promises.</li><li><strong>Greymass is an Antelope-native company. </strong>Having been with the network since Day 1, we’re committed to helping EOS and the Antelope ecosystem succeed. We’re passionate about distributed ledger technology, and using it to help lift up the communities we’re a part of. </li></ol>",

"description": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p><strong>Eco-contribution: </strong>Build a high-quality application for the Antelope IBC of EOS, WAX, TELOS, UX</p><p><strong>Public use: </strong>IBC cross-chain applications that can be used by anyone</p><p><strong>Open source: </strong>Prototype open and free for other teams on how to build a user-oriented Antelope IBC application</p><p> </p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>IBC is a technology that allows blockchains to communicate with each other, supporting features such as cross-chain token transfers. Unlike other IBC solutions, Antelope IBC offers a very safe IBC solution that does not require any additional trusted third parties.</p><p>Defibox as a leading DeFi platform in the EOS ecosystem, we will fully support and assist IBC development. Defibox will embed cross-chain functions to provide users with a good cross-chain experience so that many tokens in different chains can be freely moved under IBC solution. Defibox IBC function will eliminate user barriers through a friendly user interface, provide a convenient operation for users, and maximize the benefits brought by IBC. We believe in and are committed to creating a better future for EOS ecosystem.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public Goods</strong></p><p><strong>1. Eco-contribution:</strong></p><p>There are many benefits that IBC brings to the current DeFi landscape on EOS and Antelope chains alike. It can activate the Antelope multi-chain and increase the TVL of each chains; IBC also enables other Antelope alliance - WAX, TELOS, etc. To take advantage of the EOS version of USDT provided by Binance, making the EOS version of USDT a safer USDT entrance for the entire Antelope ecosystem. As the leading DeFi platform on EOS, Defibox will also provide support for IBC, which can greatly enhance the positive effect of IBC and make contributions to EOS and Antelope.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Public use</strong></p><p>With the opening of IBC, users are now able to easily move assets between Antelope networks and take advantage of various staking opportunities, such as Yield+, to earn more yield. Defibox IBC support will eliminate user barriers through a friendly user interface, realize convenient operations for users, provide an easy cross-chain solution through IBC, and maximize the benefits.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3. Open source</strong></p><p>Antelope IBC is a very good innovation. Many possibilities can be made based on IBC, so that everyone can benefit from it. Defibox IBC application will show a prototype to other teams how to build a user-oriented application based on Antelope IBC to achieve convenient operation. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Fund raising:</strong></p><p>The Stage 1 development duration is 2 months, giving support to various Defibox IBC functions; Later on based on the needs, we might have other new stages of development. We hope to raise $25,000 to cover some of the development costs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is IBC:</strong></p><p>Quoted from ENF website: “In less technical terms, a user can lock up a token on Chain A, then prove on Chain B that the token is locked, in order to mint a new token representing that asset on Chain B. When a user wants to move their tokens back to Chain A, they can reverse the process. This involves burning the token on Chain B and proving that it is burned on Chain A, so that the original token can be unlocked there. ”</p><p> </p><p>For more information about IBC, please visit:</p><p>https://eosnetwork.com/blog/antelope-ibc-deep-dive-seamless-horizontal-scaling-launches-on-eos/</p>",

However, the entire system, as any other involving the sourcing of opinions from the crowd, is built on the premise that they have enough information at their disposal so as to be informed well enough about the subject matter to reach informed, valid, and legitimate conclusions, however different these conclusions may be from one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Part of the information required in a reputation based system, as is the one within who&#39;s confines we are working, is information related to who the participants are in the community, but more specifically who they are in terms of their level of activity, involvement, trust, and degree to which the community is satisfied with their contributions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/0ddd32fd-2c3c-4abe-bb62-882f041b375a.png\" width=\"335\"></p><h3><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>We believe leveraging the most recent technological developments in blockchain such as Non-Fungible(NFT) and Non-Transferable(NTT) Tokens, will be a multipronged approach to solving the lack of an Open Standardized Illustrative Reputational System (OSIRS) that our community is suffering from.</p><p><br></p><p>We propose that by leveraging NTT&#39;s we can incentivize and guide participation towards events of varying significance, and who&#39;s possession can then be valued accordingly by those in who&#39;s interest it is to have, and those interested in selecting for those who posses a specific NTT, or set thereof. This will create value in Community Activities increasing participation, which will result in a stronger Community, allowing for non-members to objectively value the Community, and as a biproduct, also value Community Members and their contributions, which will attract both greater membership and non-members wanting to leverage the Community for their projects.</p><p><br></p><p>By leveraging NFT&#39;s we can allow for both the development of the Fractionalization of Members involvement in given activities, further incentivizing involvement and increasing participation, as well as the value of those activities and of the members themselves participating in them and facilitating the creation of economies and Mechanisms for Rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>The end goal being that we are able to create an objective means to measure Participation, Contribution, Community Recognition, and simultaneously allow for a member to leverage these into generating value for themselves and for others.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>Scope</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The initial scope of what we plan to build will form the UI and UX and consist of the following:</p><ul><li>Badge Issuer: Issues badges for members to claim and build their NTT.</li><li>View and Claim NFTs and NTTs</li><li>Mint your own NFTs or copies of NTTs that you hold</li><li>NFT Cutter: Will be built on top of NTTs and will create NFTs</li><li>Reputation Distributor: Will be built on top of NTTs</li><li>Rewards Distributor/Automatic Minting Mechanism: Will be built on top of NTTs and be used to distribute “Gotcha”(Name Pending) which will act as rewards to be claimed and given out by Eden Members.</li><li>System for backing/blending NFTs with other assets</li><li>Retroactive Distribution of NTTs for past participation of members in elections</li><li>NFTs published will be on the Atomic Assets and Simple Assets standard</li><li>Search bar for NFT categories</li><li>View various members various scores of engagement</li><li>Pluggable component that display badges received by member in an organization. Organization/app can plugin into their code.</li><li>UI for organization to issue/exchange badges between members.</li><li>Third UI where a user can see their badges from across organizations.</li><li>Spider Participation Graph: used to visualize and illustrate the participation style of each member.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We believe it is of more benefit to the community to be able to evaluate specific aspects of a persons engagement, rather than have a global score at a glance. Therefore, the goal will be to establish a series of categories for which authorized parties will be able to mint and issue NTTs and NFTs to participants, distribute recognition rewards, and back NFT&#39;s with different assets, effectively developing an accrued score in each of these categories. These categories will be used to define the outer edges of the spiderweb and illustrate where the member sits on this web. Simultaneously, through the Search Bar, one will be able to view “ranked” members in any given category, allowing interested parties to filter for the type of engagement they value. However, we will categorically avoid weighting and amalgamating these categories into one global score. Once this can be accomplished, electors will be better informed, the elected will be more deservedly selected, and degrees of misplaced trust avoided. This will also facilitate the growth of Repu-Fi, where members will be able to leverage and monetize their reputations in the ecosystem, and in so doing, objectively defining the value that is being harnessed within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The underlying code for NFT/NTT minting, distribution, and filtering will be open sourced along with much more which will allow for others to replicate their own reputation systems, as well as scale this one to serve a community much larger than Eden. We win together.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/ede7115d-f394-40f7-97f0-ebbb4a1df66d.png\"></p>",

Here are the public goods of the Noah protocol provide:</p><p><br></p><p>Noah Swap is a decentralized exchange that allows users to freely trade on the chain. As a DeFi infrastructure, Noah Swap is open to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Open source</strong></p><p>Noah Swap is a pioneer of decentralized Swap and its prototype design will be open source helping other EVM team to build a Swap system.</p><p>Noah Router：https://explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com/address/0x1c8f68e8AdBD75c23281e5c88E44D0b7023a4238</p><p>Noah Factory：https://explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com/address/0x75782A57c6522B8B17FCc01Ff11759f4535b2752</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Free and open APIs and EOS EVM nodes:</strong></p><p>As Noah Swap is aim to be the largest Swap on EOS EVM, we expect to see large amount of TVL and liquidity pools in our Swap. Those liquidity pools consist of tokens, and those token price will be shown in Noah Swap. And Noah is able to provide APIs (token price, token amount trade vlomne, TVL, etc.) for any other project teams who wish to get.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, in order to better serve users in EOS EVM, Noah has developed RPC URL EOS EVM network nodes for free for users to choose. Users can select the network on the official website of Noah, and switch between the Noah node and the EOS EVM main network node: https://api-evm.noahark.pro</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Noah Background</strong></p><p>Noah is composed of community members and aims to open a new generation of exchanges that are more decentralized and &#34;zero&#34; risk. In the future, we will explore many possibilities on new DeFi, which includes but not limited to: upgrade on the basis of the Uniswap V3 algorithm, providing users with leveraged market-making and leveraged incentive functions; Cross-chain DeFi between EOS and EOS EVM combined with DeFi aggregator functions, and many other innovations we can dream of. We will try our best to make Noah an innovative leading DeFi on EOS EVM.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Development plans:</strong></p><p>The Noah Stage 2 development duration is 4 months or longer depends on the version.</p>",

"summary": "EasyElm-EOS facilitates the interaction of EOS smart contracts using the Elm programing language. It's an open source tool developed internally at Cambiatus that facilitates and speeds up software development.",
"description": "<p>Interacting with contracts from web apps can be challenging. We need to send the data in the correct format, which is very easy to get wrong and can be a difficult problem to diagnose. At development time, application developers need to consult the contract implementation (or a block explorer) to find out what data the contract accepts. The developer also needs to &#34;translate&#34; the data - from the app&#39;s language to the language the contract understands. Furthermore, if a team makes any changes to the contract, it can be difficult for other teams to notice this change and adapt the application, which can lead to errors for end users.</p><p><br></p><p>Eos contracts have an ABI (Application Binary Interface) - a document that specifies all the data that the contract can receive or send to other applications. We can use these ABIs to generate code that facilitates interaction with contracts using the Elm language. Due to the functionalities that Elm has, this makes it impossible to send incorrect data to contracts, in addition to facilitating and speeding up the work of web developers. The generated code provides all the information a developer needs to interact with contracts (no need to consult the contract implementation or a block explorer), and eliminates the step of translating the Elm data into the language the contract understands.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to generating code that developers can use to interact with contracts, we can generate forms, pages, or even entire applications to interact with contracts.This way someone who has developed a contract and wants a simple application to use or test the contract can publish an application on the public internet from a single button click. Developers who want more control can generate forms or pages that can be used in their existing applications.</p><p><br></p><p>The public good that we are developing in Cambiatus is the use of ABIs, found in EOS contracts, to facilitate the interaction with contracts using the Elm language, as well as tools for automatic generation of forms, pages and applications. This good is non-rival as the entire developer community can benefit and learn from it. It is also characterized as non-exclusive because it will be available free of charge (open source) for anyone who wants to access and contribute.</p><p><br></p><p>We plan to work in the following milestones:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>An Elm library for describing the types of data that e-contracts understand</li><li> A command-line application for parsing ABIs and generating Elm code</li><li>Generate code to interact with contracts</li><li> Generate code to create forms</li><li> Generate code to create pages</li><li> Generate code to build apps</li></ul><p><br></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/26/deploying-with-the-click-of-a-button/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deploy with Netlify</a> (or similar) button that is customizable to create an application and make it accessible on the internet</p><p><br></p><p>With the funds from this grant, we our solution will allow application developers to have greater ease and agility to interact with contracts and contract developers will be able to have an app to test and use their contracts at the click of a button.</p><p><br></p><p>The tool is available to use in beta mode, just follow this steps:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Install the Elm library and code generation tool and use it to parse contracts.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li> Follow the instructions available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/henriquecbuss/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repository</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Deliverables are:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/henriquecbuss/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repository</a> (project source code, which also includes documentation and usage examples)</li><li><a href=\"https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/henriquecbuss/elm-eos/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elm package</a> (installable package to be used in development)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-eos\" rel=\"nofollow\">Npm package</a> (installable package that comes with the executable to parse ABIs and generate Elm code)</li><li>Elm &lt;-&gt; eos data type mapping</li><li> Code generation to read contract tables</li><li> Generating code to submit transactions to contracts</li><li> Automatic construction of forms</li><li> Automatic construction of pages, where each page corresponds to a table or action of a contract.</li><li> Automatic building of applications</li><li>Community support through discord / telegram channels</li><li>Create educational content for developers</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We plan to raise at least usd 16.000 for this tool, and the money will be used for:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Software development - 10k</li><li>Build, test and iterate the mentioned in the milestones and deliverables</li><li>Community building initiatives - 6k</li><li>Community support through discord/telegram channels, educational content for the EOS / Elm community</li></ul><p><br></p><p>About Cambiatus:</p><p><br></p><p>Cambiatus has been collaborating with the EOS community in Latin America since 2018. We are big enthusiasts of the EOSIO technology and have been building tools to enable communities to create their own complementary currencies as a way to promote financial resiliency. We are live since 2019, and currently have 8<a href=\"https://www.cambiatus.com/communities\" rel=\"nofollow\"> live communities</a> in Brazil, Costa Rica and Ethiopia, and more than 9.000 members.These communities became less dependent of fiat money and are using their tokens to reward members for positive actions.</p><p><br></p><p>Cambiatus is <a href=\"https://github.com/cambiatus\" rel=\"nofollow\">open source</a> since day 1, and we believe our communities contribute a lot for the ReFi movement happening in web3. We were awarded the <a href=\"https://medium.com/cambiatus/cambiatus-wins-international-award-blockchain-for-humanity-a5bc404520eb?source=collection_home---4------7-----------------------\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shapers Awards in 2021 Blockchain 4 Humanity Prize</a> and were also finalists at the Top Tier Impact Awards in 2021. We are collaborating with the ReFi movement in the Founders Circle and actively looking for ways to foster planetary regeneration.</p><p><br></p><p>Our smart contracts are a public good for the EOS community. They were created inspired by Bernard Lietaer&#39;s work, specifically the book &#34;Money and Sustainability - the missing link&#34;. Our goal is to continue the development of open source smart contracts that can help communities, collaborative businesses and DAOs govern themselves better and prosper.</p><p><br></p><p>The project was founded by Karla Cordoba and Ranulfo Paiva, along with experienced developer Julien Lucca and product designer Helton Ramos started the project that has been in the EOS community since 2018.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuttleworth Foundation funded Cambiatus development back in 2018, and we were the first team to present a dapp during the <a href=\"https://eosrio.io/news/eos-rio-hosts-its-first-meetup-in-sao-paulo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOS Rio meetup in São Paulo</a> (at the time the project was called BeSpiral). <a href=\"https://muguika.medium.com/first-eos-hackathon-in-brazil-hackablu-2fd38fed41a\" rel=\"nofollow\">We facilitated the first EOS Hackathon in Brazil</a> and <a href=\"https://eosrio.io/news/eos-rio-sponsors-blockchain-hackathon-in-brazils-hacktown-festival-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">collaborated as mentors in the HackTown Hackathon (September 2018).</a></p><p><br></p><p>In 2019 Luiz Hadad, former head of community for EOS Rio joined our team as an advisor and in 2020 as the lead community builder.</p><p>Thiago Canellas, EOS Rio co-founder joined Cambiatus as our advisor. Cambiatus has a tech partnership with EOS Rio and EOS Costa Rica since 2020. During 2021 and 2022 we focused a lot on onboarding new partner communities, learning and interacting from them.

"description": "<p>Being gamers at heart, we launched Wombat in 2019 with the idea of giving people a familiar, easy and fun experience to start playing games powered by blockchain, in particular EOS. We committed to that wholeheartedly, providing users with free account creation, free daily resources, an in-wallet NFT gallery and token swaps and many other features that gave people an edge playing blockchain games. Currently, over 700k people got their free EOS accounts with Wombat, signing millions of transactions for free. Although we have expanded our activity onto a few other blockchains, we keep believing in the potential of EOS, its superior UX, and its loyal community.</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;ve always believed that the games industry would be one of the main drivers of the mass adoption of blockchain technology. That’s why we launched Womplay, enabling mobile gamers worldwide to earn their first NFTs for free, based purely on their skill and dedication. Today, NFTs and Play-to-Earn are proliferating this adoption at scale. As we integrate crypto &amp; NFT rewards with more renowned titles, such as World of Tanks, Lords Mobile or RAID: Shadow Legends, we are convinced the future of gaming goes along with that of blockchain. We have witnessed just how much more engaged people are with games once there’s a play-to-earn twist to them — to the point we’ve become the biggest NFT minters on EOS. </p><p><br></p><p>We will continue expanding our play-to-earn offering. By the end of 2021 alone, we plan to launch a new gamified NFT staking platform and NFT experiences for more mainstream games in the pipeline. But this isn’t only about what we do to see EOS thrive as the best gaming blockchain. It’s about how we can help others.</p><p><br></p><h2>Our contribution</h2><p><br></p><p>For the last 2 years, the development of games and Dapps on EOS has been stagnant. However, as the market situation is changing rapidly, there is still a lot of unleveraged potential waiting to be unveiled. Being one of the most prominent wallets on EOS, we can — and we want! — to help gaming projects gain traction. Many of our users have become active residents of the EOS ecosystem, exploring DeFi hubs and NFT series — and they, just like us, would love to see a wider variety of EOS games.</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;re here to help fledgling EOS projects gain visibility and users. Besides direct listings and in-app promos, we leverage our Medium and YouTube content and social following of tens of thousands to spread the word about new platforms, initiatives and Pomelo grants to support them in reaching their goals. We stand by it regardless of their niche, although we encourage every EOS builder to give gaming a chance. </p><p><br></p><p>To all builders: Reach out to us to get your Dapps and games listed and promoted through Wombat! Our over 1.2 million users are waiting for awesome content to be discovered!</p><p><br></p><p>This will be a continuous ambitious adventure, and we want to share it with you! By contributing to this grant, you can help EOS realize its full potential and us — to maximize our efforts in this part.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>About Wombat</h2><p>Wombat has been one of the largest blockchain gaming ecosystems and, with that, one of the biggest EOS wallets with over 1.2 million users worldwide. It makes handling blockchain really easy, especially for first-time blockchain users. Wombat has been developed by Spielworks since 2018 with its headquarters in Berlin. </p><p><br></p><p>For more information visit https://getwombat.io</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2>",

"summary": "An opensource reward distribution smart contract for BP voting proxies.",
"description": "<p>We propose an opensource smart-contract module for distributing rewards for their delegators that any EOS BP proxies can choose to implement.</p><p>We came up with this proposal because there is a need for such smart-contract for the next iteration of <a href=\"proxy.eden.eoscommunity.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden Smart Proxy</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2><p>The distribution reward will be available every 24 hours. The formula to calculate the reward for each account is:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>reward = Total Staked * APR / 365 days</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Dependencies</strong></h2><p>All delegators need to be updated with the latest staked amount; therefore, periodic calls to the designated action must be made every 24 hours. Due to the fact that the programmed call is a helper solution, every account is also responsible for keeping their staked tokens up-to-date, but if it fails at any moment, the account owner will be responsible for manually updating their tokens using the update action designed specifically for these purposes.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Considerations</strong></h2><p>If the periodically calls solution stops working and the user doesn&#39;t update their staked amount of tokens and it has been over a day since the last update, those rewards will be lost. In other words, the accounts will only receive successful rewards for the last 24 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>There might be some exchange or big whale who wants to donate their APR for the public good. I.e. Eden or ENF. For this case, the smart contract will allow the delegator to choose which account the reward should be sent to. For example, we can have a new ‘Delegator’ page in the UI, in which delegators can:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Delegate to the proxy</li><li>Undelegate from the proxy</li><li>Designate to which account reward should be sent to.

"description": "<p>Introduction</p><p>In recent years, both the Internet and e-commerce platforms have experienced development from decentralization to centralization. With the advent of WEB3 era, users’ requirements for information security and awareness of privacy protection have gradually been improved.</p><p>In addition, the supervision of intellectual property rights in the globe has also been increasingly emphasized, and with the arrival of the era of blockchain and digital currency, disadvantages of traditional e-commerce platforms are conspicuously exposed.</p><p>StoreOS aims to build a pure decentralized e-commerce system, it can be used by all users with an EOS account. In the future, it will be open source, available to all users and enterprises for deployment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why do we need a new e-commerce architecture based on blockchain?</strong></p><p>Centralized systems should be maintained in traditional e-commerce platforms, so as to protect users’ information security, deal with intellectual property complaints, and carry out anti-corruption within enterprises, which results in huge costs, and these costs will eventually be transferred to the merchants and consumers. Under such circumstance, it is imperative to explore a new architecture with higher efficiency and lower loss.</p><p>StoreOS is based on WEB3, and there is no need to verify personal information like mobile phone and e-mail address when registering. The decentralized front-end layout is adopted, and there is no centralized database, thus no releasable information of users will be stored.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optimization of the economic model:</strong></p><p>The economic model of traditional e-commerce has resulted in the elimination of small and medium-sized businesses under the same category, and resources was continuously concentrated to the top end. The current development situation is not consistent with the universal values of antitrust, common prosperity, as well as a community of shared future for human beings.</p><p>Based on WEB3, StoreOS will be committed to decentralization and equality, so as to eliminate the inequality resulting from platform advantages or poor information, and so that the market can optimize itself according to the conditions of the supply and demand sides.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Promotion and optimization:</strong></p><p>Generally, competitive ranking or booth bidding is adopted by traditional e-commerce.</p><p>The overall architecture of StoreOS is distributed and does not provide a centralized or manually adjusted aggregation display. A decentralized promotion platform will be built, and the hash algorithm based on blockchain will be used as superimposing to fixed weight logic, so as to achieve a fairer random display and promotion.</p><p>No matter what the future of the project is, our team promises that it will never offer bidding competitive ranking using the advantages of the platform. We believe in <strong>Decentralized Algorithm &gt; Centralized Algorithm &gt; People</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optimization of the community incentive:</strong></p><p>There is little community incentive in traditional e-commerce platforms, or the incentive of the platform is actually taking profits from merchants, and the gain of platform through activities is far greater than that of merchants.</p><p>In blockchain projects, community participation is of crucial importance. The incentive model consists of the incentives of merchants, purchasers, as well as other pan users, which will be disclosed in the whitepaper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Settlement advantages of smart contracts:</strong></p><p>As we all know, smart contracts are completely settled on the blockchain, its relatively centralized settlement method is more open, transparent, efficient and instant. Particularly, EOS, a high-performance blockchain with negligible transaction costs, has a block confirmation speed of 0.5 seconds, which can perfectly carry the e-commerce platform under the new framework.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Roadmap</strong>:</p><p>1. PRD(Project Requirements Documents) of StoreOS, detailed functional flow charts and descriptions.</p><p>2. Core payment API and the development of smart contract.</p><p>3. More contract logic development, such as payment confirmation by the purchaser, delayed payment, etc.</p><p>4. Development of smart contract for the e-commerce platform.</p><p>5. Merchant Dashboard, including IPFS one click deployment, as well as full UI realization.</p><p>6. Front-end development for merchants</p><p>7. Communication system between merchants and users</p><p>8. Platform aggregation promotion display system</p>",

"title": "Smart Contract Testing Libraries",
"summary": "",
"description": "<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/eos-network-foundation/core-blue-paper-80c26db532b6\" rel=\"nofollow\">CORE+ Blue Paper</a>, smart contract unit-testing and code validation is an essential part of the modern software development process and it is seriously lacking in the EOS and EOSIO development world. There are two main tools that are limited in functionality that have been developed by the community for this purpose but sadly they have been abandoned and are no longer fit for purpose due to a lack of funding and their uncompetitiveness in the wider market.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Existing tools</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOSFACTORY</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li>Open source and free to use</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li>Convoluted instructions with unnecessary <a href=\"https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory/blob/master/docs/tutorials/01.InstallingEOSFactory.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">steps</a> where developers need to compile the eosio source code and then build and install eosfactory. </li><li>Local node runs in background mode which can cause issues with different EOSIO configurations or software versions.</li><li>Difficulty testing multiple smart-contracts due to needing a data table for each contract.</li><li>Difficult to setup CI/CD for projects </li></ul><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.klevoya.com/hydra/about/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HYDRA</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li>The framework is developed with Javascript which is simple to install and run. </li><li>Simplified setup of CI/CD</li><li>Ability to init table data for each smart contract. This reduces code review time to understand how to insert data to each table. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li>Closed source code</li><li>Hosts EOSIO node on the user server side which can reduce performance and adds friction</li><li>Paid service. </li><li>To init table data the smart contract needs to be updated. The unit-test framework and smart contact code should be independent. </li></ul><p><br></p><h3><strong>Proposed New Libraries</strong></h3><p>To improve the developer experience on EOS and EOSIO, we propose to develop three open-source libraries that will give developers the tools needed to test smart contracts and validate code in a seamless manner that is competitive with the wider blockchain industry. These three libraries are;</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Unit-test </li><li>Code coverage </li><li>Security and code style validation</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Unit-test </strong></p><p>The unit-test library will be built with Javascript giving you the ability to dockerize a light EOSIO node that can run on any system. This allows the ability for the user to host it on their system easily and automated with the ability to test for multiple EOSIO based chains i.e EOS, WAX, TELOS, PROTON, FIO and UX. It also allows for each project to simply set up CI/CD and seed table data without modifying the contracts. All code will be open sourced under MIT so it is free for the community to use, creating no barrier to entry for developers. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Open-source MIT license</li><li>Ability to init/reset table data</li><li>Ability to test accounts and permissions</li><li>Built with Javascript</li><li>Dockerize a light EOSIO node that can be run on the users system automatically</li><li>Ability to test multiple EOSIO(EOS/WAX/TELOS) networks with links to public snapshots.</li><li>Simplified method to setup CI/CD</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Code coverage</strong></p><p>Code coverage, first devised in the 1960s, encapsulates the idea that tests should ‘touch’ all of the code under test. If the tests execute all of your code, and the results from the tests are as expected, it is less likely your code contains unforeseen bugs. Sadly, there is no available code coverage library in EOS and EOSIO. After studying existing code coverage libraries in Ethereum such as <a href=\"https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage\" rel=\"nofollow\">solidity-coverage</a> we can bridge this over to the EOS and EOSIO world for native developers to leverage.</p><p><br></p><p>Here is a list of rewrite rules we will consider to apply for our code coverage library. These are subject to change when development of the project commences. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>rewrite rules</strong></p><pre>If\nloop\nreturn\nstatements\nconditional\nfunction\nexpressions\n</pre><p><br></p><p><strong>Security and code style validation</strong></p><p>Security is critical when it comes to smart contracts especially with the rise in Defi applications. The Ethereum community has seen a number of linter tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck\" rel=\"nofollow\">solcheck</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint\" rel=\"nofollow\">ethlint</a> that are used for checking security rules and verifying compliance with style guides. This is a huge benefit for developers in the Ethereum community. Sadly, there are no available linter tools in the EOS and EOSIO space to assist developers. Our goal is to provide a linter library that consists of three functions: Security Rules, Best Practice Rules &amp; Style Guide Rules. The following rules will be considered to be included; and are subject to change during development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Security Rules: rule-id</strong></p><pre>missing-authorization-check \nmissing-assertion \ncheck-forged \ntoken-transfer \nfake-notification \nreceipt-bad-randomness \nre-entrancy-attack \ntransaction-rollback \nunchecked-action-arguments\n</pre><p><br></p><p><strong>Best Practice Rules: rule-id</strong></p><pre>code-complexity\nfunction-max-lines\nmax-line-length\nno-empty-blocks\nno-unused-vars\nreason-string\n</pre><p><br></p><p><strong>Style Guide Rules: rule-id</strong></p><pre>quotes\nconst-name\ncontract-name\nfunc-name\nfunc-param-name\nprivate-vars\ntable-name\nvar-name\n</pre><p><br></p><h3><strong>Resources, Cost and Timeline</strong></h3><p>Please see the estimated resources, costs and timeline required to execute each library. If the entirety of this budget is not reached we will build out as much functionality within the budget as possible and look for other means to fund the rest of the development such as subsequent Pomelo rounds or via direct grants. Development will start as soon as the funding campaign is completed. Please note that these timelines might be extended for QA and documentation writing. Libraries are listed in order of priority.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unit-test:</strong></p><p>1 x Technical Lead - 1 month @ $12500</p><p>1 x Smart Contract Developer - 1 month @ $10000</p><p>2 x Nodejs Developers - 1 month @ $18000</p><p><strong>Total: $40500</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Code coverage:</strong></p><p>1 x Technical Lead - 1 month @ $12500</p><p>1 x Smart Contract Developer - 1 month @ $10000</p><p>3 x Nodejs Developers - 1 month @ $27000</p><p><strong>Total: $49500</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Security and code style validation:</strong></p><p>1 x Technical Lead - 1 month @ $12500</p><p>1 x Smart Contract Developer - 1 month @ $10000</p><p>2 x Nodejs Developers - 1 month @ $18000</p><p><strong>Total: $40500</strong></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://genereos.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GenerEOS</a> are top 21 genesis block producers on the EOS mainnet and have been building and growing out the EOS and EOSIO ecosystem since 2018.

"description": "<h2>NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA)</h2><h3> </h3><h2>Introduction:</h2><h3>Hello everyone, my name is Shu Fan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT\" rel=\"nofollow\">an original NFT artist</a>. I have <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">published works</a> on EOS for more than a year, and I am also a <a href=\"https://genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org/members/shufan.free\" rel=\"nofollow\">member of Eden on EOS</a>. I plan to combine my creative experience and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCptl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden Capital</a>&#39;s expertise to jointly launch the NFT standard for traditional painting artworks on EOS in my name. Different from other NFTs, traditional painting works of art have their own unique characteristics, and it is necessary to establish exclusive NFT standards to better display their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>In the last season, this project received 35 donations totaling 49 EOS and the corresponding Pomelo funding match. We would like to express our gratitude to the EOS community. In recent months after Season 2, we have made many explorations on the development and cooperative application of NFT standards for traditional painting artworks. Finally, based on the characteristics of EOS and the <a href=\"https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract/wiki/Structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT standards of Atomichub</a>, we have explored a relatively simple and feasible traditional painting method. The NFT standard has been publicly published on Medium, &#34;<a href=\"https://shufannft.medium.com/nftart-73952f0f856b\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Art Works on EOS blockchain</a>&#34;(NS-TPA).</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The first application demonstration work - <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/template/shufan.free/6787\" rel=\"nofollow\">Found a treasure on the way home</a>, was also published using this standard, and appropriate promotion was carried out. I will publish more traditional art works based on this standard, and will continue to maintain, optimize and promote this standard on EOS. Hope you all continue to support, thank you!</h3><p><br></p><h2>Details:</h2><h3><strong>1. The changes that NFT brings to traditional painting artists.</strong> NFT, giving traditional painting artists a new platform for displaying and sharing their works, is also an epoch-making revolution for the future traditional painting art market. I am excited to be in such an era. Since I <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/asset/2199023263895\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold my first work</a> on eos.atomichub.io on April 8, 2021, <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/profile/shufan.free#sellHistory\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 160 works have been sold</a> in total, sales increased by more than 100 works compared with the previous season. The originals of each work are hand-painted originals with heart, including procreate originals , Paper hand-painted original. Let me feel the value transfer charm that NFT brings to works of art.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>2. Early explorers of NFTs in traditional painting and art works.</strong> From the market point of view, there are currently only 93 NFT collections on <a href=\"eos.atomichub.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">eos.atomichub.io</a>, but the vast majority of them are Gamefi; and my 4 collections are the rare ones, which are based on traditional paintings art works. Therefore, from this point of view, I could be regarded as one of the early explorers and leaders in the transformation and extension of traditional painting art works in the direction of NFT. At the same time, the experience of the past one year has also made me feel that the current NFT standards and forms have many restrictions on traditional painting works of art.</h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSBZ8sF3gx6NZcZ9fgqkyHHR8mVBmejixDkGpdot8xLTo\"></h3><h4>ShuFan&#39;s 4 collections</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>3. Traditional paintings and artworks have their own characteristics.</strong> The Gamefi NFT standard that is dominant in the existing market is not very suitable for traditional painting art NFTs, because Gamefi&#39;s NFTs generally have the characteristics of unlimited or huge Mints, strong correlation between NFTs, and relatively low creation costs. It highlights the playability value of the game. Traditional painting art works NFTs are different , under normal circumstances, it has a small circulation (even only 1 Mint), high originality requirements, relatively independent between NFT, relatively high creation cost, and paper-based physical manuscripts can be mailed to collectors It highlights the viewing value, scarcity and collection value of art works, and has a higher demand for protection of brands, art copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Therefore, there should be a set of NFT standards that are more specific to traditional painting works of art to better demonstrate their original attributes, collection value, and protect their artistic copyrights.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>4. The market potential of traditional painting art works is huge.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-expensive-artworks-sold-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">most expensive work</a> of art worth over $100 million in 2021, at $103,410,000, is Picasso&#39;s Femme assise près d&#39;une fenêtre (1932); moreover, according to <a href=\"https://www.masterworks.io/?utm_source=google+sem&amp;utm_medium=platform&amp;utm_campaign=art_invest-in-art_canada&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5-WRBhCKARIsAAId9Fm5DMVPE3LER8tN7d_dFjEVPKyFIXwoSdOjXEV8-nqnwDbepQDk2KcaAp0AEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" rel=\"nofollow\">the masterworks report</a>, In 2020, the global painting transaction value has exceeded 50 billion US dollars, the transaction volume has exceeded 30 million, and the market potential is huge. With the empowerment of NFT, the market potential of traditional paintings and artworks will be further stimulated.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaYBTAaw4AuMum5wzfMCzeAYfp7DMEW7Ep2sw9GfMswg3\"></h3><h4>Global Painting Market Value and Transaction Volume 2009-2020</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>5. EOS needs a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting art works.</strong> EOS is a well-known public chain whose ecology is re-prospering. Its excellent blockchain design (fast speed, low transaction cost, customized account names, etc.) is very suitable for the development of NFT. However, on Atomichub, compared to <a href=\"https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">WAX</a>, the issuance, trading volume, and trading value of the <a href=\"https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT market on EOS</a> can only be considered as an early stage. However, it is foreseeable that in the near future, more traditional painting works of art will be transformed into NFTs. It is necessary and urgent to establish a set of high-quality NFT standards for traditional painting and art works in EOS to carry this huge potential market.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>6. The funds raised will be used for:</strong></h3><h3>1. Support to update this standard to be more beautified, complete, and easier to use for users.</h3><h3>2. Cooperate with existing NFT platforms, art galleries, to attract more artists to adopt this standard.</h3><h3>3. Promote the NFT standard of traditional painting artworks. If we get enough grants, we&#39;ll create a new independent website focusing on NFT of traditional paintings and invite artists to join, etc.</h3>",

"description": "<h4>Decentralized IDs (DIDs) and Verified Credentials (VCs) are revolutionary technologies that empower individuals to have full control over their own digital identities, without relying on centralized authorities. DIDs provide a new model for identifiers that are self-sovereign, while VCs enable the secure and privacy-preserving exchange of claims. Together, they form the backbone of modern, user-centric identity systems. Now that EOS has the EVM, it&#39;s time to bring this transformative technology to the EOS ecosystem.</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Public Good</strong></h3><p>Our project serves as a public good by enhancing the security, privacy, and user control of digital identities on the EOS blockchain. It directly benefits the EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h3><p>Current identity management solutions on EOS lack the robustness and user-centric features that Decentralized IDs and Verified Credentials offer.</p><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3><p>We plan to deploy a smart contract on EOS, based on an open-source Polygon ID framework, for handling DIDs and VCs. Our issuer node, will allow authenticated users to issue and manage credentials. Additionally, we will develop a fully custom-made Polygon ID Verifier for both on-chain and off-chain verification.</p><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Outcomes for This Season</strong></h3><ul><li>Deployment of DID and VC smart contract on EOS</li><li>Integration with our open-source issuer node</li><li>Development and deployment of the custom-made Polygon ID Verifier</li><li>User interface for credential management</li></ul><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p>All EOS users will benefit from enhanced security and control over their digital identities.

The only problem back then is that NFTs were not a thing, so despite all the popularity thrust upon the artists, we never really got paid.</p><p><br></p><p>Then 8 months ago my half brother Nathan Rempel brought me into the WAX NFT scene. Life for me has never been the same.</p><p><br></p><p>WAX NFTs allowed me to do what I always wanted to do as an artist. Interact with my fans and give them artwork prizes, presents, gifts and whatever. Giving away NFTs and making super easy fun games out of my artwork is a dream come true.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out what my team of volunteer developers are building with me on WAX - <a href=\"http://www.myzicklearmy.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.myzicklearmy.io</a></p><p>I couldn&#39;t do this without them, and they&#39;re helping because it&#39;s fun.</p><p><br></p><p>With your help I can bring the tools to EOS that already exist on WAX … but make it in a way that works for the artist, rather than the investors and flippers.</p><p><br></p><p>The NFT scene needs to start building more tools that allow the artists to not only create NFTs, but to also display them in a way that makes sense to the artists vision. WAX began that process but has quickly been taken over by the big brand companies and the speculative collector.</p><p><br></p><p>EOS has a chance to be the next step that gives the power back to the individual artists that bring innovation.</p><p><br></p><p>EOS wants people to buy more EOS to keep it strong. We need to give people a reason to buy things with EOS. By building artist friendly tools, we can bring in music, songs, art and games and give people a reason to buy more EOS and grow the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what do I want to build?</strong></p><p>I would like to replicate NeftyBlocks for EOS, but make the artists page easily customizable for the artist, by the artist.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to bring the <a href=\"https://www.twosentencehorrors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Two Sentence Horrors</a> to EOS and show people that NFTs can be more than just a pretty picture.</p><p><br></p><p>I would also like to bring to life the Zombie Cats game that I started building with Nathan 8 months ago.</p><p><img src=\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaZkUg6SnubnD3ohBZkKtRznXVYieSucJzznZjxoQNc5F\"></p><p><br></p><p>By working closely with the developers we can be sure the tools and UIs they built, work for the non technically inclined and then start onboarding more artists into the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p><p>I would use the money to hire the developers that are already working for free in their spare time. Or, barring that, hire the developers they think are needed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Full disclosure</strong> - I don’t really know what is needed to build the things that I want, but I am surrounding myself with the people that know how. My expertise, besides art, is making a living by creating things. I’ve been doing it for a long time and I really want to use my experience and knowledge to help other artists earn a living creating art. All money will be put towards paying developers, and with some luck we can earn a passive income and become self funding.</p><p><br></p><p>My end game is to help artists from around the world make a living by creating their artwork.</p><p>If you have questions, find me on Twitter as @ArtistByron or on Telegram at t.me/byronsroom</p><p><br></p><p>I don&#39;t believe in hoarding things for myself. I believe very strongly in sharing what I know with whoever wants to know. The tools I am hoping to build are meant to be free for everyone. If there are fees that need to be paid, it would be to fund the developers that are building these tools and it is my strong desire that these fees are paid in a way that does not impact the end user or the artist. Fees suck, but sometimes they need to be paid to help keep the tools running smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a NOT FOR MY OWN PROFIT grant, even though I will benefit because it starts with my artwork. The end game is to help you or your friend earn a living by making NFTs on EOS.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>QUESTIONS ASKED</strong></p><p><em>are you willing to commit to making it open source? That means making the code publicly available for anyone to use/modify for their own purposes. their own clone.</em></p><p><strong>YES 100% committed </strong></p><p><em>You&#39;re building the building blocks artists and devs can use to make the interactive art experiences according to their vision</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>would be good to say you plan to make it compatible with AtomicAssets...</em></p><p><strong>IT HAS BEEN SAID - if you like what we build, please use the hell out of it and show us where we could have done it better.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Are you creating building blocks for AtomicAssets?</em></p><p><strong>YES - but I didn&#39;t know until someone told me so</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>My team consists of the gamification guru Scott (from Australia) - you can find him on Twitter at https://twitter.com/stargelnaz - he&#39;s next level smart</p><p>The other dude is named Michael but we all call him Clarkstachio - you can find him on Twitter at https://twitter.com/clarkstachio</p><p><br></p><p>We are all active on the discord for the Horde - you should join us https://discord.gg/rA3UMEkpqc</p>",

"description": "<h2><strong> CDao - </strong>A New Voting Platform For Handling Conflicts<strong>      </strong></h2><p><br></p><p><strong>The following content is from machine translation. If you have any questions, please refer to the Chinese version. </strong></p><p><strong>Or contact iunknow@163.com</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you for your attention.</strong></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3><p>CDao is a Dapp running on the EOS.It is a new voting platform that focuses on resolving cognitive conflicts and is open to users on the EOS through smart contracts. In the future,Dapps will be developed for different fields.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong> Issues </strong></h3><p>To deal with the cognitive conflict between the individuals[*1],a common strategy is to use collective decision-making.</p><p><br></p><p>⑴ In existing governance models, a voting system based on the majority principle is a common method for making collective decisions. However, it also has its own problems: </p><p>① Some members may feel that the organization&#39;s decisions are not align with their values or interests, leading to their lack of willingness to participate.</p><p>② Some members may feel that the outcome of their vote will not have a significant impact on the decision, or that they will not be rewarded or motivated enough to cause them to give up their voting rights.</p><p>③ Some members may feel that their voices are not heard or valued, or that the organization&#39;s decisions are unrelated to their interests, resulting to a lack of participation.</p><p>④ Some members may have a sense of engagement but believe that the organization decision-making process is opaque or unfair, or they may believe that members of the organization have personal interests, leading to a lack of trust in the organization. Alternatively, even if they trust the organization, they may argue that the decision-making process lacks effective mechanisms to ensure the reliability and fairness of voting results, leading to a lack of trust in voting results.</p><p><br></p><p>(2) In some areas of community governance, there are also public governance problems that are difficult to balance the interests of all parties, such as &#34;neighbor avoidance effect[*2];&#34; or &#34;reverse neighbor avoidance effect[*3];&#34;.</p><p><br></p><p>(3) In some public creation or heritage processing cases, ownership of an item is clear and shared, but the evaluation of its value by owners is subjective and different, requiring a fair distribution solution. </p><p><br></p><p> It can be seen from the analysis of question （1） that although the voting system based on the majority principle has the advantages of simplicity and high speed, its disadvantages are also obvious. Summarize as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>① The voting method is crude, such as only consent, disapproval or abstention, lacking the ability to describe the strength of consent or disapproval. Comparing a weak 51% and strong 49% may highlight the shortcomings of this system.</p><p>② Lack of incentives in the voting process: lack of appropriate incentives for neutral opinion holders or majority opinion minority holders;</p><p>③ The vote are extremely unfair to the minority opinion holders: the opinions of the minority opinion holders are neither adopted nor compensated;</p><p>④ In some multi-choice areas, the conclusion of voting may be inconsistent: such as the voting paradox[*4];</p><p><br></p><p>For ⑵ problem, most of the governance strategy is also adopt the principle of voting, however, because there are a lot of voting options, in this case, the study of social choice theory shows: based on the majority principle of the voting system, cannot get the consistency of collective preference, such as &#34;arrow impossible theorem&#34; and &#34;pareto improvement impossible theorem&#34; the conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>In the traditional study of welfare economics, inconsistency is a problem that should be greatly avoided, often called a paradox. Although welfare economics after hundreds of years of development, however, to ensure that the consistency of collective preference has been a basic requirement (, of course, the requirement is basically no real implementation), from &#34;arrow impossible theorem&#34; to &#34;pareto improve impossible&#34; as well as a series of social welfare function research, are for the exploration of this consistency.</p><p><br></p><p>In the existing economic research, ensuring the consistency of collective preference is the basic requirement of the fairness of the decision-making. In addition, in the case that the fairness of the decision cannot be guaranteed, it is often necessary to seek the intervention of the government or the third party. However, the question is, can the intervention of the government or the third party guarantee the fairness of the results? That is the problem that ⑶ has to solve. Unfortunately, governments or third parties also struggle to establish a governance strategy compatible with incentives.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the above, the existing theoretical framework is unsatisfactory for dealing with these issues. Therefore, if cognitive conflict (and the resulting inconsistency of group preferences) is an objective necessity, are there other ways to solve the problem? Or, stepping back, do we really need to seek consistent collective preferences? </p><p><br></p><h3><strong>note:</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>[*1] For the same objective things, different people may have different value evaluation, for this objective cognitive conflict, investigate its reason, this may be because of the different language, culture, customs (and the resulting values and beliefs or positions), may also be because of the difference in knowledge background (and the resulting information acquisition and processing differences).</p><p>[*2] an acronym for the phrase &#34;not in my back yard&#34;, is a characterization of opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations. It carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them and that they would tolerate or support it if it were built farther away. The residents are often called nimbys, and their viewpoint is called nimbyism. </p><p>[*3] If the NIMBY effect is the public&#39;s rejection of negative projects, then the anti-NIMBY effect is the public&#39;s fight for positive projects.</p><p>[*4] The Condorcet paradox (also known as the voting paradox or the paradox of voting) in social choice theory is a situation noted by the Marquis de Condorcet in the late 18th century, in which collective preferences can be cyclic, even if the preferences of individual voters are not cyclic. This is paradoxical, because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other: </p><p>Suppose majorities prefer, for example, candidate A over B, B over C, and yet C over A. When this occurs, it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals.Thus an expectation that transitivity on the part of all individuals&#39; preferences should result in transitivity of societal preferences is an example of a fallacy of composition. </p><p>[*5] Arrow&#39;s impossibility theorem: the general possibility theorem or Arrow&#39;s paradox is an impossibility theorem in social choice theory that states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.  </p><p>[*6] Sen&#39;s impossibility of a paretian libertarian theorem: there is no function that can simultaneously satisfy the U *, I *, P *, *, and D *&#34;, where U *is the unrestricted domain, I *is independent and decisive, P *rejects Pareto suboptimal state, and D *is the dictatorship.</p><p>[*7] The Hurwitz theorem: In the personal economic environment, under the condition of participatory constraints (that is, the resulting configuration should be personal rational), there is no effective decentralized economic mechanism (including market competition mechanism) that can lead to the optimal configuration of Pareto and motivate people to display their true information; that is, the optimal configuration of Pareto showing preferences and resources is impossible.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>scheme</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>CDao(Chinese Dao),also can be called China distributed autonomous objectives, gives another answer to the question: CDao takes the concept of &#34;WU WEI&#34; of &#34;DAO DE JING&#34; as the governance concept, using the CDao team in 2011 issued a &#34;super fair distribution model&#34; as a specific algorithm coding model, through Smart contract, collect all participants vote, calculate the final processing results (according to the principle of subjective equality, meet the requirements of all participants).</p><p><br></p><p>First, the solutions provided by CDao are incentive-compatible and also Pareto-optimal. On the surface, this is contradictory to the theory of &#34;true preference is impossible&#34;, however, in CDao, the solution requires independent voting.Therefore, the various voting results can be regarded as completely competitive market behavior, that is, it can be regarded as complete information, which is different from the assumption of &#34;incomplete information&#34;;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Second, CDao is a system that relies on smart contracts with super fair distribution. Because the final governance scheme given by the smart contract requires comprehensive processing of all people, it is a distributed governance technology, and because the final governance scheme does not come directly from anyone (whether the majority opinion or the minority opinion), this governance has the characteristics of a certain centralized system. Therefore, to distinguish it from traditional DAO, we refer to CDao —— as a noncentralized governance technique.&#34;noncentralized&#34; here comes from the concept of &#34;DAO DE JING&#34;,Here, the wisdom of the managers is irrelevant. Because the managers do not need to make any subjective evaluation of the governance problems, but only need to allow the managers to vote on the governance plan themselves. Specifically, CDao and Super Fair smart contracts have the following characteristics:</p><p>① It is value-neutral in theory.</p><p>② It is open source in implementation.</p><p>③ It meets the needs of all participants in the results.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the contradiction of collective preference that it tries to avoid in the theory of welfare economics is exactly the core strategy of problem solving. In CDao, such conflict can not only be handled fairly, but the result is super fair to all participants.</p><p><br></p><p>Below we introduce CDao&#39;s solution —— how it solves the problem without building a consistent collective preference.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>㈠ CDao solution for problem ⑶:</p><p><br></p><p>If a,b,c are ready to split some resources p1,p2,p3.To understand easily, two assumptions are made here:</p><p>⑴ a,b, c, everyone has equal rights and interests;</p><p>The independent evaluation of the utility of p1, p2, and p3 is as follows:</p><p>①a: p1&gt;p2&gt;p3 ②b: p2&gt;p3&gt;p1 ③c: p3&gt;p1&gt;p2;</p><p><br></p><p>CDao first lets everyone to propose a fair distribution scheme (studies have shown that this distribution scheme is exists), then CDao integrates three fair schemes, and finally gives a solution, the distribution results are roughly similar to the following :</p><p>a：p1，b：p2， c：p3</p><p><br></p><p>Here, the subjective super fairness of resource allocation is achieved because both a, b, and c believe that they receive more than the average share. Of course, the core question here is how to accurately divide the appropriate share of p1, p2, and p3 in the resource X.</p><p><br></p><p>Indeed, for partitioned resources, CDao is done through a structured approach. After considering the preferences of all participants, an explicit share was constructed at a time, ensuring that all participants believed that they received the maximum share until the unallocated resources were zero, and finally each participant received the maximum subjective share.</p><p><br></p><p>For inseparable resources, CDao also employs a structural approach that allows each individual to gain an extra super fair share based on the average share, ending with each participant receiving an above-average share. Specific case can be referred to the problem⑵</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>(二) CDao solution for problem (2):</p><p><br></p><p>A town hall decided to build a gymnasium in a city. Although most citizens believe that it is necessary to build a stadium, some citizens believe that the stadium will bring noise and traffic congestion and affect the quality of life of the residents; some citizens worry that the stadium will damage the surrounding environment and landscape and affect the overall image of the community; others believe that the construction of the stadium will occupy a large amount of land resources and affect the development and planning of the community. Therefore, City Hall needs to establish a fair solution.</p><p><br></p><p>For convenience, we will briefly describe the CDao process:</p><p>⑴ City hall lease[*4] , token placement[*5] ;</p><p>⑵ The City Hall has formulated the proposal standard [*6] to collect proposals, for example, to put forward three proposals P1, P2, P3;</p><p>⑶ The City Hall organizes citizens to vote on the motion, assuming that the voting results are as follows:</p><p>P1 received support funds from 40,000 tokens;</p><p>P2 received support funds from 60,000 tokens;</p><p>P3 received support funds from 80,000 tokens;</p><p><br></p><p>(4) Final processing results of CDao:</p><p>① After the smart contract processing, the results are as follows:</p><p>P3 bill passed, paying 70,000 compensation for other bills;</p><p>P2 was compensated by 40,000 tokens;</p><p>P1 was compensated by 30,000 tokens;</p><p><br></p><p>② The super-fairness analysis of the processing results is as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>In the preference world of P1: if other proposals are rejected, each proposal can receive 20,000 compensation (for the other two proposals, the total compensation is 40,000); according to the principle of equality, P1 proposal is rejected and should receive 20,000 compensation, currently 30,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000.</p><p><br></p><p>In the preferred world of P2: if other proposals are rejected, each proposal can receive 30,000(for the other two proposals, the total compensation is 60,000); according to the equality principle;  </p><p>P2 proposal is rejected and should receive 30,000 compensation, currently 40,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000. </p><p><br></p><p>In the world of P3 preference: if the P3 proposal is accepted, the other two schemes should be compensated for 80,000 tokens (the support amount of P3 proposed is the amount of compensation for other proposals); according to the existing calculation, the actual compensation is 70,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000;</p><p><br></p><p>In summary, CDao gives a super-fair calculation that each proposal handles 10,000 more tokens than the fair share.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>⑸ Citizens withdrew their tokens [*8], and the City Hall built the stadium under the P3 proposal:</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, we can see the CDao processing process from the above:</p><p>⑴ Each citizen&#39;s vote can receive a certain voting incentive (the specific incentive amount is related to the number of tokens issued by the government);</p><p>⑵ The voting process is open and transparent, and blockchain technology can ensure tamper results;</p><p>⑶ The voting process is conducted by tokens, which provides some privacy for the team;</p><p>⑷ For each citizen&#39;s own expectations, the vote is super fair;</p><p><br></p><p>(三) CDao solution for problem (1):</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, problem ⑴ is just a special case of problem ⑵. After problem ⑵ is resolved, some conditions existing in problem ⑴ will no longer exist, explained as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>(1) CDao votes with approval and opposition (or abstention), thus surpassing the traditional majority principle. At the same time, since everyone in CDao can cast their own tokens for different proposal, the size of CDao voting can be arbitrarily refined;</p><p>(2) CDao is compatible with incentives during the voting process. As long as each participant ensures that his vote truly reflects his wishes (whether or not), the final result is fair to him;</p><p>(3) The result of CDao voting will compensate all rejected opinions, and the value of the compensation is positively correlated with the opposition force of the voters. The stronger the opposition, the more the compensation;</p><p>(4) The treatment outcome of CDao are unique and not inconsistent.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>NOTE:</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>[*1] LIU CHAO，WANG WENJIE，SUPER FAIR DISTRIBUTION BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE[C]，INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENT CONTROL(ICMSIC 2011),2011-8:368-372</p><p>[*2] Both assumptions are made to handle convenient settings that are not required in the actual processing of CDao.</p><p>[*3] The resulting value depends on the specific utility assessment of a, b, and c for these three items.</p><p>[*4] The tokens for voting are provided by CDao, and City Hall rents tokens from CDao for proposal collection and voting.</p><p>[*5] City Hall provides the sale of tokens, the number of tokens by the city hall, the number of excess tokens sold by citizens (usually does not exceed the number issued, the actual value by the City hall, can be used for final voting incentives or other public operating capital), including the total number of tokens for each citizen is determined by the city hall.</p><p>[*6] City halls can set basic requirements for a vote on bills, such as how many tokens can support them, or decide whether all bills can be voted on.</p><p>[*7] Every citizen can vote to support more than one proposal.</p><p>[*8] In each bill, all participants can be compensated (or refund the supported amount) in proportion to the number of tokens supported through the tokens sold by the City Hall.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>The season target</h3><p><br></p><p>The main goal of this season is to complete the launch of CDao. Specifically, it includes the following functional modules:</p><p><br></p><p>(1) Launch a super-fair distribution contract;</p><p>(2) Launch a proxy voting contract;</p><p>(3) Launch a proxy voting contract;</p><p> </p><p><br></p><h3>Project beneficiaries</h3><p><br></p><p>First, CDao provides services in the form of smart contracts, so its direct beneficiaries are the various Dapps and the service providers behind them, who do not need to redesign the incentive-compatible voting system;</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the design concept of CDao is to meet the needs of all participants, so the ultimate beneficiaries are the various users participating in the voting;</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the end point problem in the traditional welfare economics —— Inconsistent, is just the starting point problem of CDao —— super fairness. Tolerance and equity will be an important cornerstone for the future development of web3. Therefore, CDao will become an important change in the field of distributed self-management, and will also be an important governance model in the field of decentralized management. Therefore, for both community governance and decentralized applications, CDao will help EOS systems take the lead in future web3 development [*1].</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Online time </h3><p><br></p><p>The development plan of the CDao 1.0 version is about three months, and it is scheduled to be delivered online by the end of December 2023. The specific schedule is as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>October 31,2023: Make the interface access documents and complete the system design;</p><p>November 31,2023: Code writing;</p><p>December 15,2023: Test and Audit;</p><p>December 31,2023: Online;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Financing and functional development plan</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>All the funds raised by the project will be used for smart contract development, code audit, project promotion and related hardware facilities upgrading [*2].</p><p><br></p><p>If support time permits, additional work also includes, but is not limited to, the publication of high-quality research papers to expand the impact of CDao and EOS in the field of distributed governance.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Subsequent Development Plans </strong></h3><p><br></p><p>CDao plans to further develop and promote in the following two areas (building DAPPs and corresponding smart contracts): </p><p><br></p><p>(1)Building a price discovery system for on-chain assets: </p><p>Construct a mediated trading system with third-party guarantees to discover the price of on-chain assets. Different guarantors can enjoy different guarantee commissions and have different guarantee obligations based on their guarantee prices. When there is cognitive bias for assets, it can reduce the trial-and-error risk for all participants. </p><p><br></p><p>(2)Building a conflict resolution system for the NIMBY problem:</p><p> Construct a small-scale voting system (targeting not only DAO organizations) that includes functions such as proposal collection and voting. The collection and voting for each proposal are completed through tokens, and for any participant, one of the following situations will occur: </p><p>1) their proposal is accepted by others, and their voting bid is compensation for others (after the smart contract calculation, any surplus will be returned to their account, which CDao ensures will be returned); </p><p>2) their proposal is not accepted by others, and they will enjoy compensation from others based on their proposal (in general, the compensation price is slightly higher than their proposal price. CDao guarantees that according to the principle of equality, the compensation received by participants must be higher than their proposal price). </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Long-term Planning </strong></p><p><br></p><p>CDao&#39;s long-term operating plan includes (if you have a development team in the relevant area, you can also contact us for cooperation):</p><p><br></p><p>(1) Provide fair voting solutions for DAO or non-DAO organizations, and develop the corresponding DAPP;</p><p>(2) Provide complete conflict solutions for NIMBY or anti-NIMBY problems, and develop corresponding DAPP;</p><p>(3) Although the CDao theory is based on separable resources, the existing application sites are mostly based on nonseparable resources. Therefore, in the future, there may be provided (mainly focusing on visual processing) and develop corresponding DAPP.</p><p>(4) Although many people currently believe that supernodes affect the decentralization of EOS, we believe that EOS will become the best practice place for CDao as long as the underlying consensus protocol is adjusted appropriately. So, in the future, we may provide some suggestions for community governance in order to expand the number of super nodes and ensure the super fair distribution between the super nodes.</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>Other Information</h3><p><br></p><p>The CDao team members have rich experience in C++ application development and project management for over ten years.

"summary": "",
"description": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We are building a platform that will allow anyone with an EOS account to participate in the ownership of physical solar power generation facilities. By decentralizing the ownership of these clean, renewable power generation facilities, we help to enable the financing needed to build MORE renewable power generation. Our project will contribute to a cleaner, greener and safer planet for all.</p><p><br></p><p>The funds will be used to develop the UI / frontend and EOS wallet integration with an existing backend service that facilitates the tokenizing of assets. This work product will be open sourced when complete, so any other EOS project that is attempting to tokenize physical assets in this manner can bring their product to market with less friction and more rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>Our current estimate for development of our MVP is: $250 to $300K. We are investing $100K of our own funds, so therefore would need another $150 to $200K of SEED financing.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>EnergEOS™</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Energy powers our modern society, and renewable, sustainable energy production is one of the key growth industries worldwide for the next several decades.</p><p><br></p><p>Team EnergEOS™ was formed to expand the development and adoption of the EOSIO platform in the renewable energy and sustainable transport industries. The impressive scalability, transaction speed, very low power consumption and support for ultra-high-volume IoT transactions make EOS ideally suited to provide the next generation of blockchain infrastructure for these markets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Energy DeFi</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our first product is a regulatory-compliant tokenized financing platform for solar power facilities. This platform will effectively replace traditional financing models to streamline and reduce the friction in finding multi-tenant financing solutions for Solar facilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Investors of any size will now be able to easily begin, expand, and/or diversify their sustainable portfolio by owning a stake in consistently yielding renewable power generation facilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Solar power plant owners, with minimal fees and fast placements, will be able to recapitalize or deleverage to support expansion or other business needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Our product suite will:</p><p>• Facilitate the tokenization, sale, and subsequent ownership of Industrial scale Solar Facilities.</p><p>• Provide asset owners a portal to initiate and execute a compliant tokenization of their Solar asset(s).</p><p>• Allow any investor to acquire and trade ownership of the tokenized assets.</p><p>• Track and display the performance and generated revenue by the tokenized assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EOS Mainnet Integration</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Since Energy markets are highly regulated in most countries of the World, our platform will also have to be regulatory compliant. Therefore, all sensitive energy production &amp; consumption data will be stored on a private blockchain under KYC / AML guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p>However, we will be providing two growth aspects for the EOS public chain:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1)</strong> All solar industry professionals, and prospective investors on our platform will have to sign up using an EOS account. This will be the main gateway to our platform, and hence will drive the adoption of the public chain into senior industry executives and influencers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2)</strong> We will provide period hashes of key project data to the public chain, to provide full transparency and tamper evidence of the portfolio of projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ray Shilling, Managing Director</p><p>Chris Barnes, Director</p><p>Kevin Cameron, Director</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Watch our Videos:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For more information, please review our Web site summary and watch the following two video clips.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Interview with Chris Barnes</u></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xcbBQPNCumM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/xcbBQPNCumM</a></p><p><br></p><p><u>Technology Overview</u></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://energeos.io/tokfin/assets/EnergEOS_TokFin_Fundraising_2021.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://energeos.io/tokfin/assets/EnergEOS_TokFin_Fundraising_2021.mp4</a></p>",

The EOS blockchain offers many unique advantages for blockchain gaming, such as fast block time, low transaction fees, human-readable domains, and a superior NFT standard. We all know that already, right? But still, there are multiple other chains leading the race in gameFi. This grant is all about building the platform <strong>fueling gaming on EOS.</strong></p><p><br></p><h3>What we have built?</h3><ul><li>Imagine a mix of steam (for your game library) and dappRadar (for your game stats)</li><li>The goal is to use on and off-chain analytics (nft volume, smart contract stats and social media metrics) to rank a blockchain game. Every metric by itself does not mean a lot, but combining these metrics helps new users to find quality blockchain games.</li><li>We have built a UI that can be used without a computer science degree and offer explanations about certain technical terms on the page to help new users dive into crypto.</li><li>We believe that a blockchain game can consist of multiple NFT collections on one or more chains and that an NFT collection can also be used by multiple games at the same time. We have built the infrastructure needed to reflect such multi-chain, multi-collection games on our platform.</li><li>We offer a game browser that allows users to filter games after genre, development stage, and more.</li><li>The browser is free both for game publishers as well as users. No charges apply for listing or using the platform. We might introduce paid features such as ads in the future, but the core functionality will always stay free.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Current Stage of the platform:</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/3e4d4c6a-0ff1-4f66-95e6-a84362f37f4b.png\" width=\"559\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/04a615df-101c-4d82-b4a9-a45df1ae355c.png\" width=\"559\"></p><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/d7c03506-50b5-4773-ad03-4dcc87f28618.png\" width=\"559\"></h3><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/dafb130b-2f23-4086-a707-47b719c8e2c9.png\" width=\"559\"></h3><h3><br></h3><h3>How we will use the Grant money:</h3><ul><li>Adding a full NFT integration for EOS NFTs, by hosting our own APIs and nodes. You can see the functionality we are offering for the WAX chain already. A successful Pomelo grant will allow us to add the same functionality for the EOS blockchain.</li><li>Advertising the platform and its games to new users (outside of the EOS ecosystem)</li><li>Improving the UI/UX of the platform and bringing new features such as more in-depth stats</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Who is blacklusion?</h3><p>We have a track record of building tools for antelope-based chains. We have been around in the WAX blockchain community for over 3 years now. Just recently we are branching out to the EOS chain as well.

"description": "<h4><strong>Note: </strong>A stable-coin protocol implementation would be much more beneficial to the whole community if implemented at the EVM level. This is because of the nature of gas fees on EVM which are designed to burn EOS with every transaction. Therefore, although such a protocol can be designed and implemented either at core level or at EVM level, I decided to apply to the EVM pool. This way, technical details of the study and eventual implementation get aligned from the beginning.</h4><h1><br></h1><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Effective stable-coins (SC) and stable-coin protocols (SCP) are a major need for every crypto ecosystem. </p><p><br></p><p>Being of public interest, the ideal SC should not channel funds to any centralized party; much less if this channeling goes in detriment of the stability of the coin itself. Instead, in order to maximize liquidity, the incentives to those willing to borrow SC into existence should also be maximized. </p><p><br></p><p>This grant presents a high-risk, super-high-reward SCP. The protocol is initially designed with the following two goals:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Maximizing the probability of maintaining peg during dramatic market downturns. </li><li>Maximizing the incentive for new liquidity providers to appear under these extreme circumstances. </li></ol><p><br></p><p>The aim of the grant is not to implement the code of the SCP itself on the EOS EVM. The grant aims to conduct the preliminary research in order to bring a deep understanding to the EOS-EVM community of the behavior of such protocol (and possibly other discovered protocols along the way) under a wide range of conditions. The results of this study will be published, in the open, in any or several of the news channels currently working on the community. The respective implementation and software verification and validation is something that, if the current grant is successful, the community and its governance bodies can later decide on. </p><p><br></p><h1>Motivation</h1><ol><li>High volatility presents itself as one of the factors that hinder the stability and growth of SCP.  </li><li>SC creators are fundamental to the proper functioning of these systems. Yet they risk losing their collateral at the hands of centralized entities whenever the market goes down. It would be much more fair if earnings were distributed among those who took on the higher risk. </li><li>In addition to incurring in the risk of losing their collateral, people who borrow SC into existence are usually punished with unpredictable interest rates. </li><li>Aside from the risk to borrowers, high volatility has in the past destroyed stable-coin protocols; usually by provoking them to lose peg. This has hurt also SC holders. Such was the case of UST (Luna&#39;s stable-coin).</li><li>To each debtor his debt, that has been the premise in pretty much every SCP. When such premises are relaxed, incredible possibilities and fascinating behaviors may appear. </li><li>Because this protocol can be run on EOS EVM, and because EOS is burn with every EVM transaction, This protocol implementation could be fundamental in making EOS an overall deflationary asset. </li></ol><p><br></p><h1>The proposed protocol</h1><ol><li>Anyone can stake EOS as collateral in order to borrow stable-coins into existence. That newly created SC may be pegged to USD, Chinese Yuan, gold or any other commodity. It doesn&#39;t matter. </li><li>In order to incentivize the liquidity of these newly created assets, such a loan is <strong>fully free of interest</strong>. </li><li>The borrower needs to keep a minimum collateral ratio (MCR) in order to avoid losing his position. That MCR is a parameter whose optimal value needs to be defined but that can be much lower than what current protocols demand. The reason for this is presented in the following numerals.</li><li><strong>Here is where the fun begins: </strong>Whenever a given borrower fails to keep his collateral above MCR, he loses his position. </li><li>However, this position is not liquidated. Instead, it is transferred to all the other well collateralized borrowers, in a pro-rata basis. The details of this part of the protocol are yet to be defined. </li><li>The above point implies that as long as there is at least one borrower with collateral above MCR, the peg will be held and the stable asset will be fully backed. </li><li>It also implies that no amount of collateral is directed towards any other entity different than the set of healthy borrowers themselves. </li><li>Another implication is that those borrowers that manage to keep their positions open during extreme market circumstances can have enormous profits whenever the market recovers. This is because, by then, they will have been transferred the collateral (and debt) from all those who failed to maintain their positions, even if those positions were much bigger than the initial positions of the survivors.</li><li>All this incentivizes the creation of small positions with high collateral ratios under extreme market circumstances. This is, so far, an unseen and very innovative approach in the SCP market. </li><li>Ideally, find ways of rewarding the position holders, so as to help them minimize the risk of losing their positions. </li></ol><p><br></p><h1>Use of funds</h1><p>The collected funds from this grant will be used as follows:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Research current competing SCP and publish a corresponding review paper.</li><li>Develop and publish a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">discrete event type simulation</a> of the proposed protocol.</li><li>Scan the parameter space of such simulation in order to identify the optimality region, unexpected behaviors, possible outcomes under extreme circumstances, etc.</li><li>Familiarize the EOS community with the results and open source the findings and the corresponding simulation code. </li><li>Identify variations of the proposed protocol so as to create additional room for innovation. </li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Superb thanks to all those who have supported me so far, one way or the other!</p><p><br></p><p>Let&#39;s go EOS EVM!</p><p><br></p><p>With all sincerity and pure heart, </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Jorge Ramos</strong></p>",

"summary": "The vision of the fisher system is to make the world free from deceit. Through cutting-edge technical capabilities to ensure that two parties on a zero trust basis can trade or exchange things securely.",
"description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>The fisher system is inspired by an ancient Chinese fable: the snipe and the clam fight, and the fisherman gains. The fisher system is a trust-free transaction system between strangers through self-service mortgage. The two parties in the transaction can control the other&#39;s excess collateral through the fisherman system, and after the two parties have completed the exchange, the collateral can be released through the fisherman system to achieve safe transactions. This process does not require the intervention of a third-party entity, which is simple and convenient. By managing the lock-up period and small amount control, you can prevent the risk of loss caused by money laundering cash flowing into your account. The cost of doing evil in the system is very high. In theory, anything can be safely traded through the fisherman system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Application Scenario</strong></p><p>In our lives, we often encounter transaction needs between strangers. However, because of the complexity of the society, there are many cases of deception and disguise. This makes us look for a trusted third party as a transaction intermediary when we have transaction needs. Then these professional trading intermediaries often have to get expensive commissions, or simply look down on small and medium-sized trading businesses. This system can solve this pain point perfectly and elegantly, with low cost and convenient use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Compliance</strong></p><p>Compliance is one of the key factors for the long-term operation of the project, and the project party attaches great importance to the compliant operation of the project. Therefore, the system can have different implementation model designs, either based on a coin-free model blockchain or a coin-based blockchain based on an incentive model. In the future, products with corresponding versions can be launched according to the laws and regulations of different regions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project budget (in USD)</strong></p><p>1. The minimum available system(MVP) 12,000</p><p>2. Complete system 30,000</p><p>3. Telegram robot 10,000</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project Progress</strong></p><p>1. The current (2022-03-27) project white paper has been published on the project website, and the project-related content has been communicated with the community, and community questions have been answered.</p><p>2. The coding of the MVP contract has been completed, the consistency between the actual coding and the design is being checked, and the code contract is being tested.</p><p>3. The front-end coding adjustment and improvement, the progress of this part is slightly slower due to the new technology involved.</p><p>4. The current progress is generally close to the estimate of the first season of pomelo. After the front-end DAPP interface is adjusted, it will be tested on a small scale in the community.</p><p>5. The current progress is slightly ahead of the estimated second season of pomelo, and users can now register for free to get the security provided by the fisher system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plan</strong></p><p>Based on the current situation, preliminarily formulate future goals. The project will probably proceed as follows. Some adjustments may be made when the situation changes. If after seeing the product in the community, like-minded friends join, or there is financial support for multiple parallels, then the product can be accelerated or enhanced.</p><ol><li>Establish the minimum available product (MVP) as the beginning of the new iteration cycle, and the realization of this goal is set at the end of every quarter in 2022.</li><li>Strive for resources to audit the project: Looking forward to the establishment of the audit force by Beard to support the audit of community projects, because the audit cost is very expensive.</li><li>Establish a DAO organization, take over project development, marketing and publicity work, and continue to improve products.</li><li>Carry out open source work in an orderly manner.

Since EOS is also developed based on C++, I have the advantage of being proficient in C++ for a month. I have a taste of the exquisite design of the EOS system in code reading, and I have learned a lot from it. And after hearing the complaints of people around on the pain points in life, I got the inspiration to design the system. After learning some blockchain concepts, I started to implement the system.

"summary": "Organix is a synthetic assets protocol running on EOS. By over-collateralized the OGX tokens, synthetic assets such as cryptocurrencies, commodities and indexes can be minted and traded with the support from oracles.",
"description": "<h1>Background</h1><h1><br></h1><p>DeFi ( Decentralized Finance ) is one of the most suitable scenarios for blockchain ( decentralized, transparent, anonymous, trustworthy and value transmission, etc. )</p><p>In 2015, Ethereum brought Smart Contract into blockchain and with years of user accumulation and continuous contributions from the developers community, which led to plenty of projectes issued their token on the Ethereum Network. This is the main reason why DeFi can be developed on Ethereum. However, due to the performance bottleneck, high transaction fee and low TPS of Ethereum, DeFi is still unable to be widely popularized and applied[1]. The current mainstream DeFi projects on Ethereum have about 1,000 daily activities only[2].</p><p><br></p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Organix is a decentralised synthetic asset issuance and trading protocol based on EOS chain.</p><p>Synthetic asset is a financial tool used to simulate basic assets ( like Financial Derivatives ). Usually it requires excess collateral to mint synthetic assets, and the prices are synchronized from the real assets through an oracle.</p><p>MakerDAO is a synthethic assets protocol on Ethereum, and DAI which is staked and minted from the protocol is called the synthethic asset. Its price is pegged to the US Dollar, backed by multiple excess collateralized assets such as ETH, meanwhile, a certain staking rate and liquidation rate are used to ensure the stability of the DAI&#39;s price.</p><p>OGX is the basic token on Organix protocol, which can be used as collateral to mint OUSD. OUSD is the stable coin in the whole system, the system always values 1 OUSD at 1 USD backed by a 800% initial collateralisation ratio, to ensure the price of OUSD can absorb large price shocks of OGX. Synths can be exchanged with OUSD on the synthethic exchange of Organix system through prices supplied by oracles, included but not limited to fiat currencies, commodities, cryptocurrencies and their inverse assets.</p><p>Since the minting of synths doesn&#39;t need real assets or counterparties, it only requires enough supported value and stable oracle price feeding to mint a variety of and unlimited amount without consideration of problems of cross-chain assets and tokenized assets, which solves the problem of insufficient liquidity and homogeneous types of token of DEX currently.</p><p><br></p><h1>Main Functionality</h1><h2>1. Stake OGX, Mint or Burn OUSD</h2><p>All OUSD are minted by excess collateralized OGX initially, initial collateralisation ratio ( C-Ratio ) is 800%. The number of OUSD a user can mint depends on the number of OGX he holds and locks, the user will incur debt when he mint OUSD, and to unlock the OGX he must pay back this debt. After the user mints synths, it will take 3 days before it can be burnt.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>Alice has 400 OGX, and the price of OGX is currently 2 USD, so Alice can mint 100 OUSD at most, she incurs the 100 OUSD debt in the system with 800% C-Ratio . If she mints only 50 OUSD, her debt will be 50 OUSD with 1600% C-Ratio.</p><p>Users&#39; C-Ratio varies from price to price, they can increase the C-Ratio through staking more OGX or burning some OUSD. To be paid attentions, everyone&#39;s debt will vary according to the total amount of debt in the whole system and the debt ratio of all users. To unlock your staking OGX, you can take it back anytime after 3 days&#39; staking when you pay back the debt (OUSD). For debt calculation, please refer to Debt Calculation.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Staking Rewards From Inflation And Exchange Fee</h2><p>The weekly claimable OGX inflation rewards and exchange fees are allocated based in the proportion of debt each users has issued. In order to claim the rewards, the users&#39; C-Ratio must be larger than minimal C-Ratio, which is 800% initially. Users can adjust their ratio by burning synths or stake more OGX when it falls below 800%.</p><p>Due to the high C-Ratio, the system has no liquidation merchanism at the moment, the penalty for C-Ratio that lower than 800% is the inability to claim inflationary rewards and exchange fee rewards, but it doesn&#39;t exclude the possibilites to reduce the C-Ratio and add the liquidation merchanism after the governance module gets mature later.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Exchange Synths</h2><p>Through Organix&#39;s synthetix assets exchange, various synthetic assets can be traded according to the price of the oracle conveniently. Cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and EOS, commodities, gold, crude oil, inverse cryptocurrencies like iBTC, iETH, iEOS and any other assets that can be digitally simulated, without consideration of slippage and liquidity limitation, and charge an exchange fee which is 0.2%. And 0.18% fee is extracted and sent to the fee pool to reward OGX stakers, the other 0.02% will be sent to referral pool, or will be sent to the fee pool if there is no inviters.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Example :</strong></p><p>Alice holds 1000 OUSD, current price from oracle is 200 USD/ETH, so Alice can use her 1000 OUSD to buy 1000<em>0.998/200 = 4.99 OETH. And 1000 </em>0.002 = 2 OUSD will be extracted and sent to fee pool. If Alice is invited, so 1.8 OUSD will be sent to the fee pool and the other 0.2 OUSD will be sent to the inviter&#39;s personal revenue pool.</p><p><img src=\"https://2940131818-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fi6SHmiE0ckeMAdardeDC%2Fuploads%2FerUKB2DwG6xsaQs8KWBu%2F%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8711.png?alt=media&amp;token=596cd860-6aa1-4bda-a302-94999a928dae\"></p><h1>Core Logic</h1><p><br></p><h2>1. Debt Calculation</h2><p>The debt calculation is the most complicated part of the the Organix system, users will incur a debt when they stake OGX to mint OUSD, at this moment, the debt is the same as the minted OUSD amount. However, as the transactions and prices of synthetic assets continue to change in the system, the users&#39; debt will increase or decrease, which is related to the total debt in the system.</p><p>If stakers pay back the debt, they can retrieve the staked OGX and will no longer be affected by system debt.</p><p>For an example, there are only two users in the system at the beginning, Alice and Bob. Both of them stake and mint 100 OUSD and incur a 100 OUSD debt. Total value of synthetic assets in the system is 200 OUSD, total debt is 200 OUSD too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Case #1:</strong></p><p>Both Alice and Bob bought OBTC, when OBTC halves in price, the total value in the system halves, and the debt in the system would halve too, so each of the user&#39;s debt halves. Their debt changes from 100 OUSD to 50 OUSD, the synthetic assets value at 50 OUSD too. They can get back their staked OGX after pay back the debt. Although the price of OBTC drops, but none of them lose.</p><p><strong>Case #2:</strong></p><p>If Alice bought OBTC and B still held the OUSD, when price of BTC halves, total debt ( total value ) in the system changes to 50 + 100 = 150 OUSD, reduced by a quarter, so each one&#39;s debt reduced by a quarter. Alice and Bob both incur a 75 OUSD debt, but Alice&#39;s synthetic asset values at 50 OUSD at this moment, Bob still holds 100 OUSD. Alice needs to pay extra 25 OUSD to pay back the debt and get back the staked OGX, but Bob earns 25 OUSD without doing anything. Alice&#39;s OBTC halved, but she lost a quarter only.</p><p><strong>Case #3:</strong></p><p>If Alice bought OBTC, Bob bought OETH, and then BTC was up 50% and ETH was up 10%, at this moment, the total debt ( total value ) in the system changes to 150 + 110 = 260 OUSD, which is up 30%, so both Alice and Bob&#39;s debt changes to 130 OUSD. And Alice&#39;s OBTC worths 150 OUSD, Bob&#39;s OETH worths 110 OUSD, so Alice earns 20 OUSD but Bob loses. At this scenario, although price of ETH went up, Bob still needs to pay extra 20 OUSD debt.</p><p>When there are fewer users and asset types, the total debt in the system will flutuate largely, but as the number of users and types of tradable assets increase, especially the inverse assets ( tracking the reverse trend of assets ), the total debt changes in the system will be more stable.</p><p>The following is an example of total debt changes caused by a price fluctuation：</p><p><img src=\"https://2940131818-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fi6SHmiE0ckeMAdardeDC%2Fuploads%2FKFlynRKDdKxcEb0TM2Nq%2F%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8712.png?alt=media&amp;token=9371b69c-1dfc-4423-b17d-ae7d8ecbf960\"></p><p><br></p><p>There are two types of changes in debt pool and individual debt :</p><p><br></p><ol><li>The total debt in debt pool increases or decreases when holders mint or burn synths, the individual debt won&#39;t change, bu the proportion will.</li><li>The total debt in debt pool increases or decreases when total value of synths change, the individual proportion won&#39;t change, but the debt will.</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>2. The Oracle</h2><p>Limited by the consensus model of the blockchain, smart contracts can only call internal contract information, and cannot directly obtain information from systems outside the chain. The Blockchain Oracle is an implementation mechanism for the interaction between the blockchain and the external world. It establishes a trustworthy bridging mechanism between the blockchain and the external world, so that external data can enter the blockchain safely and reliably[3].</p><p>The oracle is the core module in the Organix protocol. The prices of all synthetic assets in the trading system are provided by multiple oracles. Use algorithms from multiple sources to form an aggregate value for each asset.</p><p>At the beginning of the project, Organix will use its own oracles and third-party oracles to provide the price feed of synthetic assets. The price information of synthetic assets will be weighted by combining multiple oracles on-chain and off-chain, multiple price sources and historical prices within a certain period to ensure the stability and to avoid early deal caused by price fluctuations and untimely price updates.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. The Inflation</h2><p>To incent holders who engages into stake actively, the total supply will inflate from 100,000,000 to 245,000,000 in 3 years after the system launches, the inflation rate will decrease year by year. The inflated tokens are distributed to stakers weekly on a pro-rata proportion of debt each staker has issued. All the stakers who meet the minimum C-Ratio requirements of the system can claim the token, and tokens that are not claimed or allocated will be redistributed in next round.</p><p>The reason of the protocol&#39;s inflationary monetary policy is the debt, from stake OGX to mint OUSD, can fluctuate ( refer to Debt Calculation ). So the system designs inflation rewards and exchange fee rewards. With the gradual increase in transaction volume in the later period, the incentive effect of transaction fees will be more obvious. Just like BTC&#39;s incentives to miners, inflationary rewards will become less and less, and the proportion of miners&#39; fees will gradually increase.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. The Referral Mechanism</h2><p>The referral mechanism on EOS is quite mature, many successful projects have confirmed that the incentive effect of this mechanism is positive. No matter decentralized wallets, portal like DApp store or other DeFi projects that are re-developed based on the protocol, even the individuals can benefit from promotions. The referral mechanism is carried out by adding a corresponding invitaion account for each transaction.</p><p>Because there is no counterparty and can be traded unlimited, and charge an exchange fee which is 0.2% each transaction, of which 10% of the fee or 0.02% will be sent to inviter&#39;s revenue pool. We encourage any projects, teams and individuals who recognize the protocol to integrate it or the DApp into their own services, and benefit from it.</p><p><br></p><h2>5. Liquidity Incentive and Stake Incentive</h2><p>In the early stage of the project, users can engage into trading of synthetic assets through staking OGX to mint OUSD only. In order to attract more users to participate in the trading of synths, we encourage everyone to provide liquidity for synthetic assets and other basic assets in third-party liquidity pools, not limited to swaps, loans and other DeFi protocols. In this way, even without OGX, users can exchange or borrow other assets to achieve various synthetic assets and experience the convenience brought by the trading of synthetic assets.</p><p>At the same time, in order to maintain the stability of the debt pool, the staking incentives of some synthetic assets will be increased according to the total debt of the system. For example, most of the assets in the system are on OBTC. The rapid up or down of BTC may lead to the instability of the total debt of the system, then we can increase the staking incentives for the inverse asset IBTC, making the total debt of the system more stable. Tokens for both liquidity incentives and staking incentives are deducted from the inflationary OGX. In the early stage of the project, some incentive policy decisions may be made by a small number of people in the community. Later, decentralized governance and even automated adjustments will be introduced.</p><p><br></p><h1>Roles and Policies in the Ecosystem</h1><h2>1. Stakers</h2><p>Stakers stake OGX to mint OUSD and incur a debt, and earn staking rewards which includes inflationary rewards and exchange fee rewards, but they also incur a risk of debt fluctuations of the system, the minted OUSD can be used to trade all synthetic assets actively. Users can also passively hold or provide liquidity on a third-party platform to earn additional incentives and market-making rewards from the corresponding platform. In short, your counterparty will be the other users in the entire system when you hold debt.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Debt-Free Traders</h2><p>Debt calculation in the Organix is a complex system, but for debt-free traders, it is a perfect trading platform. You can get all kinds of synthetic assets through swaps or loans, and then trade on Organix Exchange with unlimited liquidity easily. The rise and fall of assets value ni longer need to be affected by total debt, but truly reflect the income situation, which is the same as the exchanges we usually use, and the value of these synthetic assets are backed by sufficient collaterals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1>Risks and Strategies</h1><h2>1. Current Risks</h2><p>There are several risks in the system, as Organix is a complex system:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>The main risk involves the debt OGX holders issue when they stake and mint synths. As previously explained on Debt Calculation, this debt can fluctuate due to the exchange rate shifts within the system. This neans that to exit the system and unlock their staked OGX, they may need to burn more Synths than they orginally minted.</li><li>Risks from price fluctuations in the OGX token. As the only collaterals in the early stage, all synthetic assets&#39; price are backed by the collaterals. If price of OGX pummets by over 80% in a short period of time, the synthetic asset will lack sufficient value, and the value of the synthetic asset may be unpegged from the underlying asset value.</li><li>There are a number of aspects of the system that are currently centralised, examples of centralisation is the C-Ratio and distribution of rewards among other projects.</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>2. Risk Mitigation Strategies</h2><ol><li>Regarding the debt fluctuation, more diversified assets need to be added for adequate hedging. Through the connection between synthetic assets and basic assets, as the number of users grows and the existence of arbitrageurs will be gradually stable.</li><li>Regarding the OGX price fluctuation, as the project gradually be stable and doesn&#39;t depend on the inflationary rewards of OGX, other assets included but not limited to stable assets like EOS, USD(x), BTC, ETH will be gradually added to the system, which also increase the scale of the funds available in the system.</li><li>Regarding the governance, we will regularly discuss with various partners and community members to ensure that the project goals are consistent with the community, and gradually realize decentralized governance when the system become stable and mature.</li></ol><h1><br></h1>",

"summary": "",
"description": "<p>LIQUEOS is developing 2 decentralized apis one that will pull real time data for synthetic assets. And the second is a liquidity api. It will look through all of the orderbooks onchain and increase liquidity for a token and increase liquidity on the eos ecosystem by being able to monitor it.   </p><p>Bots can be designed to create arbitrage within trading based on liquidity which increases the liquidity of an ecosystem.   </p><p>The market of crypto-synthetic assets has been steadily gaining traction. According to the latest available estimates, there is more than $69 million locked in synthetic derivative contracts. To understand this growing importance of synthetic assets, we have to take a step back and find out what synthetic assets are and how they are relevant to the world of crypto. </p><p>In the traditional world of finance, the term synthetic assets refer to a combination of assets that bear the same value as another asset. Generally, the assets that are combined belong to the derivative asset class. These derivative products can be options, futures, or swaps. The combination of these derivative products follows the value of an altogether different asset class. These underlying assets can be stocks, bonds, commodities, indexes, currencies, or interest rates. </p><p>Let’s try to understand this phenomenon with a real-life example. Suppose a trading firm has not directly purchased a stock. Instead, what it has done is, it has purchased a call option on the stock and then sold a put option on the same stock. Through this strategy, although the investment firm is following the value of the stock, it is diversifying the risk associated with stock among two different assets. </p><p>Crypto synthetic assets follow the philosophy and deploy the same strategy. Crypto-synthetic assets offer investors exposure to other types of assets without actually holding them. These other types of assets can be instruments of traditional finance such as currency or commodities or index funds. They can be other types of digital assets as well. </p><p>The holders of crypto-synthetic assets hold these assets in a tokenized form. What it means is that the investors hold tokens whose value follows the value of assets belonging to a different class. This helps investors to expand their investment avenues without having to leave the domain of cryptocurrency. Moreover, crypto-synthetic assets also enjoy all the benefits associated with a decentralized financial system. These benefits include the deployment of smart contracts, a secure environment of a decentralized system, and the facilities that come with the distributed ledger technology. </p><p><br></p><p>The Role in Defi</p><p>Crypto-synthetic assets have found a wide range of applications. Here, we will try to look at some of the most prominent use cases.</p><p> </p><p>MakerDAO: </p><p>MakerDAO is somewhat similar to Abra in its approach. In the case of MakerDAO, investors use Ethereum as collateral. In exchange for keeping Ethereum as collateral, Maker DAO offers an opportunity to mint a synthetic asset named Dai. The value of this synthetic asset follows the value of US dollars. In effect, the holders of crypto assets, which is Ethereum in this case, get exposure to the price fluctuations of USD. </p><p><br></p><p>Rainbow Network: </p><p>It offers an off-chain non-custodial exchange as well as a payment network that supports any liquid asset. A user can trade, lend, borrow, send, and receive any liquid asset through a singular on-chain payment channel. The on-chain payment channel uses a single asset as collateral. All the transactions happen off-chain. </p><p>The project is called the Rainbow network because it is comprised of Rainbow channels, a variant of payment channels. In the Rainbow channels, the computation of the settlement balances is based on the prices of the other assets. </p><p>The advantage of a Rainbow channel is that it supports both long and short positions on any asset as long as the participants agree on a price oracle. </p><p>  </p><p>Synthetix: </p><p>One of the most popular projects in the world of crypto-synthetic assets is Synthetix. Synthetix is a combination of an issuance platform, a collateral type, and an exchange. It offers users the facility to mint synthetic assets. The users put up collaterals to mint one. These minted synthetic assets can then be exchanged for another type of synthetic asset. This exchange is moderated by a price oracle. The uniqueness of Synthetix is that there is no counterparty to this exchange. Instead, what the user does is repricing the collateral as per the price oracle. </p><p>  </p><p>The advantages of synthetics: </p><p>Now that we have got an overview of how crypto-synthetic assets are put to use, let us try to understand why these assets are gaining ground so quickly. Crypto-synthetic assets help the world of DeFi to chain real-world assets in a way that is credible and trustworthy. </p><p>The world of DeFi lacks financial instruments. Investors in the traditional world of finance enjoy a lot of financial instruments. Resultingly, they can deploy a variety of strategies with different combinations of these instruments. Synthetic assets in the DeFi environment help extend the availability of financial instruments and investment strategies. This results in better risk management and an increased volume of trading. Increased trading volume improves liquidity. </p><p>Synthetic assets also help to mitigate challenges associated with weak cross-chain communication protocols. The DeFi environment still suffers from these issues. But, with the help of synthetic assets, users can trade in assets without having to own them. </p><p>The popularity of crypto trading has still been restricted to crypto enthusiasts and within the group of people who are well-aware of the DeFi environment. Synthetic assets help to overcome this limitation. People who have traditional fiat currencies to invest in or people who want to participate in the traditional market can now do so without having to leave the blockchain environment. </p><p>This facility helps to expand the user base for cryptocurrency overall. </p><p>Crypto synthetic assets are only going to get bigger in market value in the days to come. The opportunities to mitigate risks by deploying a wide range of investment strategies on a diverse set of assets is going to prove useful. It will encourage existing crypto investors to trade in increased volume and pull in traditional investors to the world of decentralized finance. </p><p>We believe there is a way to add more value to the eos ecosystem through synthetics, and the liquidity api. Other apps can use our apis to improve the eos ecosystem liquidity and use to build products like synthetics </p><p>We believe that by open sourcing this technology we can make more efficient markets and better user experience for the end users. </p>",

"title": "eospyo: a python signing library for eosio chains",
"summary": "The purpose of eospyo is to make it easy to interact with blockchains from backend python services. Our goal is to make eospyo the de facto python library for eosio. This project is a joint-venture between FACINGS and DLT.",
"description": "<p>Despite the utility of eospyo in its current state we believe that the following features and improvements can bring wider adoption of not just eospyo, but eosio in general as python is growing in popularity and becoming one of the most used languages in the world¹. </p><p><br></p><p>We believe it would be beneficial to the eosio ecosystem to extend the library to attract many developers that are learning to program and using python. Additionally, some education entities are switching long time used languages to python in their introductory courses² this would lead to even a greater popularity of python among the new generation of programmers.</p><p><br></p><p>Although there are others python libraries to interact with eosio networks³ we believe that eospyo project is the only one suitable for wide production use, like eosjs. </p><p><br></p><p>As such we are offering a tiered program. With the first $15,000 being used to add the improvements and new features listed first and with additional features we will be able to build out at stretch goals.</p><p><br></p><h3>$15,000 milestone gets these features (or as many as we can afford to do with under $15K):</h3><p><br></p><ul><li>New Feature: CI/CD pipelines. Create pipelines using github actions to ensure quality and updated docs and reduce the burden and time to create these essential features for the maintainers.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>New Feature: Deploy Smart Contracts. Implement features that would allow teams to use python in their DevOps architecture to deploy smart contracts directly to the blockchain. Python is a very commonly-used language in devops, behind only bash and go.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Improve Documentation. Docs help users of the libraries and they are a pattern of successful open source projects. Given the blue ocean of developers that will be attracted to the eosio ecosystem for the first time by this library, this would be a great opportunity to educate them on the advantages of eosio as well and thus attract additional talent to our ecosystem.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>New Feature: Interfaces to the atomic assets smart contracts. Python is known for its clear and concise syntax. We can leverage that and make the interactions with atomic assets (and other smart contracts in the future) smart-contracts really easy. This would be issued as a separate library requiring the eospyo library</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If we exceed the initial target ask we are offering the following additional stretch goals. At $20,000 raised we will implement the following:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Create Feature Testing Module for pytest. We will create a pytest plugin to make easier to develop EOSPYO unit tests with mocked blockchain responses because blockchain calls are error prone due to network and blockchain eventual consistency. This feature would allow developers to replicate these errors to be sure application code is prepared to handle these errors. This is a good design pattern for developing robust backend systems</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Create Feature Transaction Deserialization. Full deserialization of transactions will allow data to be read from created bloks and create data pipelines in python. This would enable the ecosystem already developed for data science, data analysis and data engineering in python (which is huge) to readily incorporate blockchain data. We believe this would make eosio blockchains among the first one to offer ready made tools for accessing this huge ecosystem</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If we hit $30,000 on the grant, we will implement the following feature:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Create Feature Ledger Support</li><li>Develop an eospyo plugin to sign transactions with hardware wallets.</li><li>As this will create coupling to specific wallets we will build this as a plugin architecture allowing users who don’t need these services to not be burdened with extra unused code in their projects.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>References</h2><p>(1) Stackoverflow trends: </p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/e17eeee1-8547-4393-9c4b-1dfe1191ad79.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjavascript\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjavascript</a></p><p><br></p><p> Google trends: </p><p><a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F02p97\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/dc3c2e20-a695-4f2c-9dfc-e88eb1a2135a.png\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F02p97\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F02p97</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>(2) M.I.T.

Even for experienced users, managing resources remains tedious and cumbersome.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p><ul><li>We believe building an open-source solution to automatically manage CPU and NET would greatly increase the user experience of the EOS Network, help lessen barriers to entry, and increase network activity overall.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution - ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>Stake ECPU to receive automated CPU + Net Powerups Daily. Stake can be delegated to multiple users.</li><li>ECPU can be thought of as a CPU equity which represents ownership in a permanently locked pool of EOS, where returns are paid in the form of CPU and NET daily.</li><li>ECPU allows a one-time setup solution to CPU and NET. It will allow dApps to delegate CPU and NET to users for a daily allotment that requires zero effort for recipients, and minimal effort for dApps. The EOS pool will also be locked out of circulation, and will continue to grow with mining, REX appreciation, and excess voting rewards. ECPU will add deflationary pressure to the supply of EOS, which in turn will benefit all EOS holders.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Users</strong></p><ul><li>DApps managing resources on behalf of users</li><li>Users of DApps that do not pay for resources</li><li>Users onboarding friends and acquaintances </li><li>Power Users</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><ul><li>The smart-contract will hold a pool of EOS staked to REX with voting assigned to Reward Proxies.</li><li>Income from Reward Proxies will be utilized for automated CPU+NET powerups for all stakers of ECPU.</li><li>Token distribution will be credibly neutral, difficulty-adjusted mining, where contributing small amounts of EOS to the smart-contract pool will reward ECPU tokens. No developer allocation, pre-mine, or benefit to insiders whatsoever. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><ul><li>ENF Recognition Grant recipient SOV Labs LLC has experience creating dApps including SOVDEX(https://sovdex.io/ https://soveos.github.io/SOVDEX/), BTCMiner (www.btcminer.one ), SAFE (https://soveos.github.io/safefrontend/), and XSOV (https://soveos.github.io/xsov.app/).  </li><li>SOV Labs LLC also has previously utilized difficulty-adjusted mining to power automated payout and buyback systems (please see sovdexpaydiv and sovconverter contracts) and has created a token (SVX) with the ability to delegate its utility to other users.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Finances</strong></p><ul><li>Grant funds will be used to fund the initial smart-contract EOS pool (which will be locked out of circulation), as well as fund development of the open-source smart-contract, and open-source application front-end. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Success will be measured with the following deliverables:</strong></p><ul><li>Releasing working dApp with open-source smart-contract and open-source front-end code that fulfills design requirements (see slide).</li><li>Deploying a working initial instance of the open-source code.</li><li>Locking the Keys of the contract to 15/21 BP permission / locking the EOS Pool out of circulation.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Design Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Users staking ECPU must be able to receive daily pro-rata allotments of CPU + Net Resources without needing to sign any transactions. </li><li>Users must be able to delegate staked ECPU to multiple accounts from a single account.</li><li>ECPU must be a transferable token with credibly neutral mining system defined as: no team supply, no pre-mine, and difficulty adjusted by mining activity.</li><li>The EOS Pool must not be able to be withdrawn or be reduced, and must be locked out of circulation.</li><li>Waste Reduction method- example solution.. powerups will be delivered pro rata to stakers in according to total ecpu supply.

ECPU is a superior solution as it allows dApps to manage their ECPU delegated stake for their users, abstracting away CPU and NET costs completely for users. Unstaked ECPU is also liquid and transferable, allowing the owner to earn from providing liquidity, exchange for other tokens, and send to other accounts at their convenience.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why You Should Help Fund ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>ECPU will help create a better User Experience while adding flexibility and options for all EOS users. </li><li>ECPU will also put deflationary pressure on the EOS supply benefiting all EOS holders.</li><li>ECPU will have a fair distribution that will allow anyone to have liquid and transferable equity in a compounding pool of EOS.</li><li>ECPU contract and application code open-source and an asset to the community.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you for supporting EOS through Pomelo and reading our proposal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

If these servers are fallen down, you cannot react the game anymore. In on-chain gaming, all game logic and assets are implemented on blockchain, that means there is no server.Our on-chain game will be exist, even if we as developers are not exist anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>The benefits of on-chain games can be accumulated on these terms: financial security, composability, interoperability and true sovereign economy in game. Let me explain these terms :</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Financial Security: </strong>Because of we do not rely on any centralized entity such as servers to serve game. Our financial assets are more secure compared to other web3 games. Think that, you invested some standard web3 games, and because of some centralized issues, the developer company is bankrupted and all game servers are down. That means game is not exist anymore and that makes your financial assets valueless. In on-chain games, there will be no such a situation because game&#39;s lifetime is equal to blockchain&#39;s lifetime not developer&#39;s lifetime.</li><li><strong>Composability: </strong>Because of our games is fully decentralized, any user can create their feature to our game.</li><li><strong>Interoperability :</strong> One of the best property of blockchains is the interoperability between protocols, because all game is implemented on blockchain, the game will be interoperable, any game use our data in their game, or we can use other on-chain games&#39; data to create fun features.</li><li><strong>Sovereign Economy: </strong>Our game has also property of being a protocol. Our game will has own economy independent from developers. This can provide good motivation for user-generated contents. With good incentive mechanism and composability, game can achieve content richness.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Our game has the properties stated above. Let&#39;s return the details of our game.</p><p><br></p><h3>Game Design</h3><p><br></p><p>Chaquer&#39;s design is inspired from Age of Empires series. Basically users can deploy castles, create their armies to fight each other. You can reach screenshots via <a href=\"chaquer.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\">chaquer.xyz</a>.

"description": "<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/16235141-93c6-4a85-a14f-29c55f9e490e.png\" width=\"480\"></strong></p><p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p><p>This grant proposal aims to support the development and implementation of SmartSale EVM, an EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract, specifically focusing on the Dutch Auction functionality to enable builders to raise more funds in a multi-chain environment. By bringing the proven benefits of the Gnosis Dutch Auction to the EVM ecosystem, we aim to address the challenges faced in traditional fixed-price token sales, promoting fairer token distribution, price discovery, and inclusive participation. This proposal outlines the problem we aim to solve, our proposed solution, detailed product features, a roadmap for implementation, and the public goods offered by the SmartSale EVM.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p><p>Traditional fixed-price token sales in the blockchain ecosystem often face issues related to unfair pricing, oversubscription, and undervaluation. These problems stem from the lack of a mechanism that allows for efficient price discovery and inclusive participation. Additionally, there is a need for a robust and customizable smart contract solution that enables token issuers to conduct secure and auditable Dutch Auctions on EVM chains.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract offers a solution to the challenges mentioned above by introducing a dynamic Dutch Auction mechanism. By implementing this functionality on the Ethereum blockchain, token issuers can conduct token sales with fairer price determination, efficient allocation, and increased inclusivity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Product Details:</strong></p><p>The EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract will be designed to replicate the core features of the existing Ethereum Dutch Auction Smart Contract while incorporating unique enhancements to improve the product. The key features of the smart contract include:</p><ol><li>Dutch Auction Mechanism: The smart contract will enable token issuers to conduct Dutch Auctions, starting with a high initial token price that gradually decreases over a predetermined period. Participants can submit bids at any point during the auction, and at the end, successful participants will receive tokens at the final clearing price.</li><li>Customizable Parameters: The smart contract will offer flexibility in defining auction parameters, including the duration of the auction, initial token price, minimum bid increments, and the target amount of tokens to be sold.</li><li>Advanced Token Distribution: The smart contract might support various token distribution models, such as pro-rata distribution based on the amount of bid, tiered allocation based on different bid ranges, or allocation weighted by a reputation system.</li><li>Whitelisting and KYC Integration: The smart contract may include optional features for whitelisting participants and integrating Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, enabling token issuers to comply with regulatory requirements and ensure a secure and compliant token sale.</li><li>Integration with External Services: The smart contract may provide hooks and interfaces to integrate with external services, such as oracles for real-time price feeds or identity verification services for KYC checks.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Roadmap:</strong></p><ol><li>Research and Analysis: Conduct an extensive analysis of existing Dutch Auction implementations, identify best practices, and assess potential improvements and enhancements.</li><li>Smart Contract Design and Development: Design and develop the EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract with a focus on usability, security, and compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.</li><li>Testing and Auditing: Conduct rigorous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security audits, to ensure the reliability and robustness of the smart contract.</li><li>Documentation and Developer Support: Create comprehensive documentation, guides, and examples to facilitate the adoption and usage of the EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract by developers and token issuers.</li><li>Community Engagement and Adoption: Collaborate with the Ethereum community, developer forums, and blockchain industry influencers to promote awareness, gather feedback, and encourage adoption of the EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Goods:</strong></p><p>The EVM version of the Gnosis Smart Contract offers significant public goods to the blockchain ecosystem. By providing a customizable and auditable Dutch Auction mechanism, it promotes fair and transparent token sales, fostering a more inclusive and equitable fundraising environment. The open-source nature of the smart contract ensures transparency, trust, and collaboration within the community, allowing for continuous improvements, audits, and contributions from the wider developer community. Additionally, the enhanced features and customizability of the smart contract empower token issuers to conduct secure and compliant token sales, promoting the overall integrity of the blockchain industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Open-source code:</strong></p><p>All code will be open source at:</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcashorg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bitcashorg/</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Use of funds:</strong></p><p>Funds will be used for the design and development of the SmartSale EVM infrastructure product. </p><p>Initial funds will be for R&amp;D to evaluate Gnosis Smart Contracts and evaluate improvement and enhancements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Team:</strong></p><p>The core team and partners who are building the bitcashBank DeFi wallet and P2P fiat-to-crypto onramp app. (https://app.bitcash.org) </p><p>Jun Dam and bitcash Team</p><p><br></p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>dBoard (Raised $19,019 on Pomelo.

Infeos lower and simplify the entry point for new EOSIO blockchain developers, making the building and testing of EOSIO-based applications easier and faster than ever.</p><p><br></p><h2>The Problem</h2><h2><br></h2><p>Having a tool that simplifies the development process for EOSIO smart contracts from local blockchain environment setup, to smart contracts compilation, deployment and testing is a must.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, EOSIO still doesn’t have a unified tool that is maintained, regularly updated, and easy to use for developers. Similar development tools, that came after infeos, aren’t active and/or supported anymore. This complicates the development process for developers, especially for the new ones coming to EOSIO.</p><p><br></p><p>While infeos is working and we’ve been using it the past few years for the EOSIO-based projects we worked on, it needs improvements, bug fixing, documentation, and optimization to some of its functionalities.</p><p><br></p><h2>The Goal</h2><h2><br></h2><p>Our goal with the grant is to make infeos even more powerful, more developer-friendly, easier to use and bring a number of new functionalities that will ease developers even more.

"description": "<p><span>The Fortis Name Service intends to revolutionize the way Ethereum Name Service works. This will be done by bridging the Antelope chains together with the EVM. This currently works using the Fortis Wallet, however we plan on expanding this to other wallet providers, dApps, websites and more. For now, this runs on-chain and completely free! </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>For the Antelope chains that have an EVM, it is challenging for their users to use  different applications as they would essentially have to use more than one wallet to interact with protocols. However, with our API you will be sharing one identity across multiple chains. </span><span>The issue with EVM crypto wallet addresses is that they have an inconvenient amount of characters which isn&#39;t ideal. To solve this, the FNS combined with AntelopeOS gives users the opportunity to create human readable domains that route transactions to the correct address in any application that has integration with FNS. For instance, if I owned the domain &#34;john.fpay&#34;, I could have a friend send me $10 in USDT to &#34;john.fpay&#34; to pay for some sort of good or service. The funds would arrive at my Telos address that is associated with that domain no matter which wallet application my friend uses. As Telos also has an EVM, we could route transfers from Native to EVM / EVM to EVM from one wallet to another or to the same, bringing the ultimate link between the Native and EVM sides.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>Our aim is to build an easy to use API where developers can utilize their applications, which will be based on Telos Native and EVM, once this is achieved we plan on expanding it into a multichain name service by adding other Antelope chains.</span></p><p><br></p>",

Our aims and objectives are spreading word about the EOSIO Blockchain and the $EOS token through Bounties and Giveaways targeting the Crypto-Twitter community. Depending on the level of the meme creator&#39;s creativity, The best memes will be selected monthly and rewarded respectively. I believe that this strategy will help trigger a EOS market price spike which is what every EOS hodler is looking up to.</p><p><br></p><p>The EOS token is a potential coin with various use-cases and deserves rapid marketing. With this method, more crypto investors will be attracted to the coin which will cause them to invest in the coin. This will impact the market cap and enlarge the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>How it will work: Every two weeks, Giveaways will be set up on the official EOS memes account while winners of the past week will be rewarded. The prize pool can be sponsored by EOS Block Producers who see the need to support the project, but the prizes will definitely be a decent one so as to motivate community members to join/participate in the Giveaways and bounties. The reason why the Giveaways will last for a month is to enable a ton of community members to join. Every participant who doesn&#39;t follow the rules will not qualify to win from the prize pool as our team will be very strict with the rules.</p><p><br></p><p>Aside the EOS English speaking communities, I will also diversify the bounties to the Turkish, Venezuelan and African communities respectively. More communties will be impacted too along the line. The goal is to see the token&#39;s market price escalate before the end of the year.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>",

"description": "<p>Now we intend to open source the NFTSWAP standard so that any developer can participate in perfecting the standard or use the contract to build their own swap-capable NFT.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is NFTSWAP?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NFTSWAP is a new type of NFT protocol which brings significant functional improvements to the common NFT protocol. EOSCCC originally planned to develop a P2E (Play-to-Earn) game in EOS, a high-performance mainstream public chain, but encountered many pain points that can not be solved by the existing NFT standard, so it groped to develop the NFTSWAP standard. NFTSWAP is committed to improving the liquidity of NFT, and has the characteristics of EOS name type genes and growth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Characteristics of NFTSWAP</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em><u>1. Liquidity</u></em></p><p><br></p><p>NFT assets are illiquid and difficult to trade at fair market prices in a short period of time. The NFTSWAP standard provides a value scale for the same series of NFT, thus creating a NFT Swap that allows people to immediately Swap them into other cryptocurrencies according to their own needs.</p><p><br></p><p><u>2. Genes</u></p><p><br></p><p>The NFTSWAP standard asset will have a genes that uses the EOS-specific name type, which is no more than 12 characters long, and each character must be one of the following: .12345abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. By freeing the NFT from a single still image fragment, the community can give different genes definitions, thus creating a variety of images for each NFT that match the genetic characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p><u>3. Growth</u></p><p><br></p><p>Let the NFT created by using this set of standards have more vitality, and through the smart contract, NFT can change and grow according to the rules of the game, upgrade the state value, increase the intrinsic value, and so on.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project debriefing</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As of March 2022, a beta version has been developed, and the code warehouse is as follows：</p><p>https://github.com/eosccc/nftswap_standard</p><p><br></p><p>EOSCCC is based on the NFTSWAP BETA standard and is developing a P2E (Play-to-Earn) game based on the EOS network-Crypto Cycle. It will include the most popular games, including basic game functions, NFT collection and exchange functions, and DeFi pledge mining functions. At present, the online hero blind box function, all heroes can be instant Swap, trading is very convenient.</p><p><br></p><p>We submit this funding proposal in order to gain the support of the EOS community, better improve the NFTSWAP standard, promote the development of the basic use case Crypto Cycle, and tap the full potential of the standard.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Crypto Cycle</strong>：https://game.eosccc.com</p><p>       https://cccgamefi.netlify.app</p><p><strong>Telegram</strong>:https://t.me/ccc_token</p>",

Since then, we have had the trust of the community to produce thousands of blocks as well held the rank as a paid standby producer.

"summary": "",
"description": "<p>Being gamers at heart, we launched Wombat in 2019 with the idea of giving people a familiar, easy and fun experience to start playing games powered by blockchain, in particular EOS. We committed to that wholeheartedly, providing users with free account creation, free daily resources, an in-wallet NFT gallery and token swaps and many other features that gave people an edge playing blockchain games. Currently, over 700k people got their free EOS accounts with Wombat, signing millions of transactions for free. Although we have expanded our activity onto a few other blockchains, we keep believing in the potential of EOS, its superior UX, and its loyal community.</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;ve always believed that the games industry would be one of the main drivers of the mass adoption of blockchain technology. That’s why we launched Womplay, enabling mobile gamers worldwide to earn their first NFTs for free, based purely on their skill and dedication. Today, NFTs and Play-to-Earn are proliferating this adoption at scale. As we integrate crypto &amp; NFT rewards with more renowned titles, such as World of Tanks, Lords Mobile or RAID: Shadow Legends, we are convinced the future of gaming goes along with that of blockchain. We have witnessed just how much more engaged people are with games once there’s a play-to-earn twist to them — to the point we’ve become the biggest NFT minters on EOS. </p><p><br></p><p>We will continue expanding our play-to-earn offering. By the end of 2021 alone, we plan to launch a new gamified NFT staking platform and NFT experiences for more mainstream games in the pipeline. But this isn’t only about what we do to see EOS thrive as the best gaming blockchain. It’s about how we can help others.</p><p><br></p><h2>Our contribution</h2><p><br></p><p>For the last 2 years, the development of games and Dapps on EOS has been stagnant. However, as the market situation is changing rapidly, there is still a lot of unleveraged potential waiting to be unveiled. Being one of the most prominent wallets on EOS, we can — and we want! — to help gaming projects gain traction. Many of our users have become active residents of the EOS ecosystem, exploring DeFi hubs and NFT series — and they, just like us, would love to see a wider variety of EOS games.</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;re here to help fledgling EOS projects gain visibility and users. Besides direct listings and in-app promos, we leverage our Medium and YouTube content and social following of tens of thousands to spread the word about new platforms, initiatives and Pomelo grants to support them in reaching their goals. We stand by it regardless of their niche, although we encourage every EOS builder to give gaming a chance. </p><p><br></p><p>To all builders: Reach out to us to get your Dapps and games listed and promoted through Wombat! Our over 1.2 million users are waiting for awesome content to be discovered!</p><p><br></p><p>This will be a continuous ambitious adventure, and we want to share it with you! By contributing to this grant, you can help EOS realize its full potential and us — to maximize our efforts in this part.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>About Wombat</h2><p>Wombat has been one of the largest blockchain gaming ecosystems and, with that, one of the biggest EOS wallets with over 1.2 million users worldwide. It makes handling blockchain really easy, especially for first-time blockchain users. Wombat has been developed by Spielworks since 2018 with its headquarters in Berlin. </p><p><br></p><p>For more information visit https://getwombat.io</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2>",

As of June 12, 2023, I have published a total of 456 pieces of content, including the weekly and monthly reports of the EOS Foundation, some individual independent opinions on EOS, more than 30 EOS related articles independently translated by individuals, such as the Hackathon contest held by ENF and the technical science popularization of EOS EVM, etc. All content has over 4 million views.</p><p><br></p><p>The account currently has 832 followers, although the number is not large, I can confidently say that we are the Chinese EOS social media account with the highest fan activity, including other social media platform.

Every content I post will have many fan comments and likes, including loyal EOS enthusiasts and of course, anti-fans. For fans who have questions, I will patiently answer them. When facing insults, I have always adhered to the principle of not defaming and tried my best to communicate positive energy with them. I believe we need a window to maintain communication with various EOS users.</p><p><br></p><p>At present, I am fully focused on the EOS ecosystem. I have played various roles in the community, including game developer (PINK MEOW), media evangelist, and community translator. With limited energy, I hope to receive financial support from the community, so I can contribute to community construction more calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>If I can receive donations from the community, I will strive to achieve the following:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Ensure that 2 high-quality EOS articles are translated and exclusive EOS articles are written every week.</p><p>2. Increase the number of Weibo followers to over 1000 and strive towards 3000.</p><p>3. Share more personal independent thinking content about EOS and create cultural barriers in the Chinese EOS community.</p><p>4. preach in other comprehensive encryption communities on Weibo , eliminate bias and misunderstandings, and promote EOS to a wider range of encryption users.</p><p>5. Try organizing offline cultural salons and community activities in my own city (Wuhan) to achieve the goal of offline communication among real users.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, thank you for your understanding and support. If EOS is not yet strong enough, let&#39;s work together to make it stronger. Empty talk is cheap, let&#39;s work together to build it!</p>",

"description": "<h2><strong>Dashboard Displayed</strong></h2><h2><strong>NonFungible &amp; NonTransferable</strong></h2><h2><strong>Token Based Reputation System</strong></h2><h2><br></h2><p>We have between our hands an incredibly powerful method for establishing consensus in the creation of a hierarchy and leadership, able to leverage the wisdom of the crowd, and scale, serving to secure the anti-fragile nature of the system.</p><p><br></p><p>The key to its success is reaching consensus amongst the crowd, so as to select what they deem to be the most important issues presented and represented by the members of the fractal, from the first level of the election cycle on up to the last. However, the entire system, as any other involving the sourcing of opinions from the crowd, is built on the premise that they have enough information at their disposal so as to be informed well enough about the subject matter to reach informed, valid, and legitimate conclusions, however different these conclusions may be from one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Part of the information required in a reputation based system, as is the one within who&#39;s confines we are working, is information related to who the participants are in the community, but more specifically who they are in terms of their level of activity, involvement, trust, and degree to which the community is satisfied with their contributions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/0ddd32fd-2c3c-4abe-bb62-882f041b375a.png\" width=\"335\"></p><h3><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>We believe leveraging the most recent technological developments in blockchain such as Non-Fungible(NFT) and Non-Transferable(NTT) Tokens, will be a multipronged approach to solving the lack of an Open Standardized Illustrative Reputational System (OSIRS) that our community is suffering from.</p><p><br></p><p>We propose that by leveraging NTT&#39;s we can incentivize and guide participation towards events of varying significance, and who&#39;s possession can then be valued accordingly by those in who&#39;s interest it is to have, and those interested in selecting for those who posses a specific NTT, or set thereof. This will create value in Community Activities increasing participation, which will result in a stronger Community, allowing for non-members to objectively value the Community, and as a biproduct, also value Community Members and their contributions, which will attract both greater membership and non-members wanting to leverage the Community for their projects.</p><p><br></p><p>By leveraging NFT&#39;s we can allow for both the development of the Fractionalization of Members involvement in given activities, further incentivizing involvement and increasing participation, as well as the value of those activities and of the members themselves participating in them and facilitating the creation of economies and Mechanisms for Rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>The end goal being that we are able to create an objective means to measure Participation, Contribution, Community Recognition, and simultaneously allow for a member to leverage these into generating value for themselves and for others.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>Scope</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The initial scope of what we plan to build will form the UI and UX and consist of the following:</p><ul><li>Badge Issuer: Issues badges for members to claim and build their NTT.</li><li>View and Claim NFTs and NTTs</li><li>Mint your own NFTs or copies of NTTs that you hold</li><li>NFT Cutter: Will be built on top of NTTs and will create NFTs</li><li>Reputation Distributor: Will be built on top of NTTs</li><li>Rewards Distributor/Automatic Minting Mechanism: Will be built on top of NTTs and be used to distribute “Gotcha”(Name Pending) which will act as rewards to be claimed and given out by Eden Members.</li><li>System for backing/blending NFTs with other assets</li><li>Retroactive Distribution of NTTs for past participation of members in elections</li><li>NFTs published will be on the Atomic Assets and Simple Assets standard</li><li>Search bar for NFT categories</li><li>View various members various scores of engagement</li><li>Pluggable component that display badges received by member in an organization. Organization/app can plugin into their code.</li><li>UI for organization to issue/exchange badges between members.</li><li>Third UI where a user can see their badges from across organizations.</li><li>Spider Participation Graph: used to visualize and illustrate the participation style of each member.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We believe it is of more benefit to the community to be able to evaluate specific aspects of a persons engagement, rather than have a global score at a glance. Therefore, the goal will be to establish a series of categories for which authorized parties will be able to mint and issue NTTs and NFTs to participants, distribute recognition rewards, and back NFT&#39;s with different assets, effectively developing an accrued score in each of these categories. These categories will be used to define the outer edges of the spiderweb and illustrate where the member sits on this web. Simultaneously, through the Search Bar, one will be able to view “ranked” members in any given category, allowing interested parties to filter for the type of engagement they value. However, we will categorically avoid weighting and amalgamating these categories into one global score. Once this can be accomplished, electors will be better informed, the elected will be more deservedly selected, and degrees of misplaced trust avoided. This will also facilitate the growth of Repu-Fi, where members will be able to leverage and monetize their reputations in the ecosystem, and in so doing, objectively defining the value that is being harnessed within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The underlying code for NFT/NTT minting, distribution, and filtering will be open sourced along with much more which will allow for others to replicate their own reputation systems, as well as scale this one to serve a community much larger than Eden. We win together.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/ede7115d-f394-40f7-97f0-ebbb4a1df66d.png\"></p>",

With rapid innovations on chains like EOS (IBC, DeGov), it becomes progressively harder to monitor on-chain developments. While block explorers excel at tracking low-level blockchain operations (like transactions, accounts, and blocks), the evolution of blockchains has necessitated the display and analysis of higher-level data such as TVL, tokens &amp; markets, IBC, and public spending. While DeFi trackers like DeFi Lama fill this gap by covering the broader market, their generalized approach often provides just a superficial view of individual ecosystems.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>The Solution:</strong></h3><p>Defeye is pioneering a new class of ecosystem explorer that showcases higher-level on-chain data and analytics, painting a &#34;bigger picture&#34; of the EOS ecosystem&#39;s activity.</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>What Sets Defeye Apart?</strong></h3><p><strong>Holistic Metrics</strong></p><p>Defeye will be the first DeFi tracker to present a comprehensive view of a cryptocurrency ecosystem:</p><ul><li>Protocols &amp; TVL</li><li>Tokens &amp; markets</li><li>Insights from IBC imports &amp; exports</li><li>Public spending</li><li>Native &amp; EVM</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Deep EOS Integration</strong></p><p>Instead of a broad, surface-level overview of the entire crypto market, we focus narrowly to provide deeper integration and insights for the EOS protocol. Current/future unique features include:</p><ul><li>Tracking asset distribution in smart contracts over time</li><li>Configurable TVL asset calculations</li><li>Inter-Blockchain Communication tracking</li><li>Monitoring EOS’s on-chain Decentralized Governance</li><li>EVM features</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Intuitive UX</strong></p><p>Designed for both technical experts and everyday individuals. Our aim is for Defeye analytics to be as valuable to the lay person curious about cryptocurrency as it is to die-hard crypto enthusiasts. The following is on our UX roadmap:</p><ul><li>Evolving Defeye into a PWA (Progressive Web App)</li><li>Plans include integrating with popular crypto chat apps and social media platforms, promoting dialogue via a range of bots and alerts offering real-time EOS metrics.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/990e5c0b-eef1-4785-8f65-18ca7ad9d367.gif\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3><p>I&#39;m an EOS genesis holder, software developer and entrepreneur looking to work on this project full time and make a significant impact in the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p>",

There are some other donation information because it is not public, it is inconvenient to list them one by one.</h3><h3><strong>4. Promote the advantages of NFTs on EOS. </strong>The ShuFan NFT project has achieved small achievements on EOS, we also would like to promote the performance potential of NFTs on EOS through our twitter and other media, incldue Fast, 0 cost, decentralization, friendly interface, custom account names, etc. Like: <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ShuFanNFT/status/1511610938146926596\" rel=\"nofollow\">example 01</a>, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ShuFanNFT/status/1396412083411902466\" rel=\"nofollow\">example 02</a>, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ShuFanNFT/status/1409877989446328332\" rel=\"nofollow\">example 03</a>, etc. It has also attracted the attention of some artists who come to us for private consultation, include oil painting, sculpture and other traditional art fields.</h3><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>Why is the ShuFan NFT project different?</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.Continuous innovation.</strong> ShuFan is an freelance artist who loves painting and open-minded, she is widely involved in world literature, film, and music, which has cultivated her sensitive, focused and unique aesthetic characteristics, and continuous innovation ability. She conceives or creates new paintings almost every day. Continuous innovation ability is a necessary condition for outstanding artists, and it is also an important human resource for the EOS ecosystem.</h3><h3><strong>2.Unique creative style</strong>. Because ShuFan&#39;s creative style is unique, the creative theme focuses on the close connection between human beings and other life in nature.

"description": "<p><strong>Background of the project</strong></p><p>When we made the fisher system, we solved the security transaction guarantee between strangers. However, users still have concerns, and feel that if they fail to reach an agreement, the loss of the defaulter will be greater than that of the defaulter, which is a bit difficult to accept. The goal of the fisherman system as the basic transaction security general system itself has been achieved. Now decentralize the adjudication platform to solve the last concern of users, so that the bad defaulters will eventually bear the loss of default.</p><p><br></p><p>But the decentralized adjudication platform is an independent platform, it is not a part of the fisherman system, nor does it serve the fisherman system specifically, it is a general platform. It is designed to resolve people&#39;s disputes.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of the existing adjudication systems are supported by finances, the adjudication efficiency is very low, and people have no choice. When people have disputes, they can only wait for the adjudication body to execute step by step. The decentralized adjudication platform can solve some of the problems, share the burden of public power, and improve efficiency at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p><p>The vision of the project is to improve the efficiency of adjudication and realize the fairness and comprehensiveness of adjudication from a global perspective through a blockchain-based incentive means model, so as to effectively supplement traditional adjudication institutions and improve the availability of global resources. participation and utilization.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the platform, people can apply to the platform or choose the adjudication service according to their own needs. If you are a professional, or have the time and ability to help people adjudicate, you can build adjudication services through the platform. Ordinary community members can join the adjudication panel and use common sense such as simple morality to help the adjudication be conducted fairly and justly. All activities will be rewarded by the system.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, services are divided into two types: human intervention and non-human intervention. Human intervention is the type of adjudication service that requires or has professional human intervention; non-human intervention type refers to the adjudication that can be completed only through the contract and the operation of the applicant.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Project application scenarios</strong></p><p>Obviously, first of all, it can undertake credit orders for disputes where Fisher virtual credit system fails to reach an agreement. Because the default dispute resolution of the fisherman system is to confiscate the collateral for donations for natural disasters. But not all people will choose this method of processing, and this decentralized adjudication platform provides a more diverse processing method. And realized the protection of the keepers.</p><p><br></p><p>Through this adjudication platform, various subdivided adjudication services can be established, because adjudication is a serious and professional matter. Therefore, professional people are needed to provide the system with professional knowledge and the smooth progress of the adjudication. All kinds of adjudication resources and forces can be listed on the platform like commodities or services.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Composition of the platform</strong></p><p>According to the main objectives of the project to be completed, the following main modules will probably be established:</p><ul><li>Service application module: the interaction module between the applicant and the system</li><li>Adjudication service management module: management of adjudication service providers and services.</li><li>Judgment execution module: When there is a judgment result, it will be executed by the judgment execution module.</li><li>Incentive module: A module that identifies platform participants and behaviors and provides corresponding incentives.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Participants of the platform</strong></p><ul><li>Adjudication Service Product (Producer) - Analogy Legislator</li><li>Adjudication Moderator (Executor) - Analogy to Legal Attorney</li><li>Jury (composed of ordinary people and professionals) - analogy to a jury</li><li>Adjudication Services Applicants</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public product description</strong></p><p>This project provides an infrastructure public platform for adjudication, allowing people to organize and publish adjudication services, and apply for adjudication services. Important adjudication data will be on the chain, and the blockchain&#39;s immutable feature ensures that the evidence chain and adjudication basis of the adjudication cannot be tampered with. It is a public platform where people can obtain more efficient adjudication services.

Blockchain technology will be with us for generations and this report will shed light on the impacts such technologies would have on the environment.</p><p><br></p><h3>Related Experience</h3><p>In 2017, I presented a study at Greenbuild Boston to explore <a href=\"https://www.usgbc.org/education/sessions/facade-design-tools-highrise-carbon-neutral-buildings-11733136\" rel=\"nofollow\">façade design tools for high-rise carbon neutral buildings</a>. The energy simulation started with a present-day TMY3 weather file for 25 years of historical data and then generated two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for a best- and worst-case scenarios. The results from analyzing the external conduction gains/losses through the building envelope is an increase of heat gain during the summertime months. The additional heat can be beneficial in the winter months but that extra load on cooling systems would result in added pressure for the electrical grid during peak hours.</p>",

"description": "<p>We propose an opensource smart-contract module for distributing rewards for their delegators that any EOS BP proxies can choose to implement.</p><p>We came up with this proposal because there is a need for such smart-contract for the next iteration of <a href=\"proxy.eden.eoscommunity.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden Smart Proxy</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2><p>The distribution reward will be available every 24 hours. The formula to calculate the reward for each account is:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>reward = Total Staked * APR / 365 days</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Dependencies</strong></h2><p>All delegators need to be updated with the latest staked amount; therefore, periodic calls to the designated action must be made every 24 hours. Due to the fact that the programmed call is a helper solution, every account is also responsible for keeping their staked tokens up-to-date, but if it fails at any moment, the account owner will be responsible for manually updating their tokens using the update action designed specifically for these purposes.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Considerations</strong></h2><p>If the periodically calls solution stops working and the user doesn&#39;t update their staked amount of tokens and it has been over a day since the last update, those rewards will be lost. In other words, the accounts will only receive successful rewards for the last 24 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>There might be some exchange or big whale who wants to donate their APR for the public good. I.e. Eden or ENF. For this case, the smart contract will allow the delegator to choose which account the reward should be sent to. For example, we can have a new ‘Delegator’ page in the UI, in which delegators can:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Delegate to the proxy</li><li>Undelegate from the proxy</li><li>Designate to which account reward should be sent to. (Default = original account)</li><li>Claim reward (manual vs automatic)</li><li>See the current APR</li><li>See how much delegators have earned</li><li>See when is the next disbursement</li></ul>",

"description": "<p><strong>WHAT is EO2?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>EO2 is a Token that cryptographically represents a ton of CO2 equivalent from the European Regulated Carbon Market. It constitutes a safe and sustainable alternative asset suitable to meet the financial needs for diversification, investment, and store of value of individuals. EO2 is also a tool to offset individuals&#39; and businesses&#39; carbon emissions more reliable and effective than those currently available in the mass market.</p><p> </p><p>EO2&#39;s Mission is to contribute to a more inclusive, efficient, and reliable Carbon Market by providing all stakeholders with easier access to quality Carbon Credits, which are currently accessible to a limited number of multinational enterprises. Our goal is achieved through tokenizing regulated Carbon Credits into EO2, which reduces frictions and improves their usability and diffusion.</p><p>The core project function is represented in a smart contract that constitutes a two-way bridge between off-chain regulated Carbon Credits and their in-chain Token representation.</p><p> </p><p>For a quick overview of EO2 project, you can take a look to the promo <a href=\"https://youtu.be/webvzEuRnRY\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>video</strong></a>.</p><p> </p><p>EO2 has achieved considerable progress in developing the UI, which has been designed considering our target users&#39; different levels of experience with technology and digital assets. Creating an intuitive user interface that simplifies the customer journey (registration, wallet, etc.) and the product cycle (buy, sell, etc.)</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW is EO2 promoting the PUBLIC GOOD?</strong></p><p> </p><p>EO2 will make open-source a ReactJS 18 UI Boilerplate with JSS and material-UI for component designs based on the user interface of our exchange platform, allowing users of the boilerplate to perform basic EOSIO-based token functionalities, like sending, receiving, exchanging, etc., account creation on EOSIO-based blockchain. This Boilerplate will be created with customizable capabilities, adapting to each developer&#39;s project. The web app can also integrate external wallets such as ANCHOR and LEDGER.</p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Join our <a href=\"https://t.me/eo2earth\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>community channel</strong></a> to give us feedback or request for support.</p><p> </p><p><strong>We welcome you all on our journey to fight climate change!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>EO2&#39;s platform available to be tested! <strong>(Available only for desktop use for the moment!)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You can have a look and create your test EO2 account on our platform at <strong>www.EO2.org</strong>.

"description": "<h2><strong>Dashboard Displayed</strong></h2><h2><strong>NonFungible &amp; NonTransferable</strong></h2><h2><strong>Token Based Reputation System</strong></h2><h2><br></h2><p>We have between our hands an incredibly powerful method for establishing consensus in the creation of a hierarchy and leadership, able to leverage the wisdom of the crowd, and scale, serving to secure the anti-fragile nature of the system.</p><p><br></p><p>The key to its success is reaching consensus amongst the crowd, so as to select what they deem to be the most important issues presented and represented by the members of the fractal, from the first level of the election cycle on up to the last. However, the entire system, as any other involving the sourcing of opinions from the crowd, is built on the premise that they have enough information at their disposal so as to be informed well enough about the subject matter to reach informed, valid, and legitimate conclusions, however different these conclusions may be from one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Part of the information required in a reputation based system, as is the one within who&#39;s confines we are working, is information related to who the participants are in the community, but more specifically who they are in terms of their level of activity, involvement, trust, and degree to which the community is satisfied with their contributions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/0ddd32fd-2c3c-4abe-bb62-882f041b375a.png\" width=\"335\"></p><h3><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>We believe leveraging the most recent technological developments in blockchain such as Non-Fungible(NFT) and Non-Transferable(NTT) Tokens, will be a multipronged approach to solving the lack of an Open Standardized Illustrative Reputational System (OSIRS) that our community is suffering from.</p><p><br></p><p>We propose that by leveraging NTT&#39;s we can incentivize and guide participation towards events of varying significance, and who&#39;s possession can then be valued accordingly by those in who&#39;s interest it is to have, and those interested in selecting for those who posses a specific NTT, or set thereof. This will create value in Community Activities increasing participation, which will result in a stronger Community, allowing for non-members to objectively value the Community, and as a biproduct, also value Community Members and their contributions, which will attract both greater membership and non-members wanting to leverage the Community for their projects.</p><p><br></p><p>By leveraging NFT&#39;s we can allow for both the development of the Fractionalization of Members involvement in given activities, further incentivizing involvement and increasing participation, as well as the value of those activities and of the members themselves participating in them and facilitating the creation of economies and Mechanisms for Rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>The end goal being that we are able to create an objective means to measure Participation, Contribution, Community Recognition, and simultaneously allow for a member to leverage these into generating value for themselves and for others.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>Scope</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The initial scope of what we plan to build will form the UI and UX and consist of the following:</p><ul><li>Badge Issuer: Issues badges for members to claim and build their NTT.</li><li>View and Claim NFTs and NTTs</li><li>Mint your own NFTs or copies of NTTs that you hold</li><li>NFT Cutter: Will be built on top of NTTs and will create NFTs</li><li>Reputation Distributor: Will be built on top of NTTs</li><li>Rewards Distributor/Automatic Minting Mechanism: Will be built on top of NTTs and be used to distribute “Gotcha”(Name Pending) which will act as rewards to be claimed and given out by Eden Members.</li><li>System for backing/blending NFTs with other assets</li><li>Retroactive Distribution of NTTs for past participation of members in elections</li><li>NFTs published will be on the Atomic Assets and Simple Assets standard</li><li>Search bar for NFT categories</li><li>View various members various scores of engagement</li><li>Pluggable component that display badges received by member in an organization. Organization/app can plugin into their code.</li><li>UI for organization to issue/exchange badges between members.</li><li>Third UI where a user can see their badges from across organizations.</li><li>Spider Participation Graph: used to visualize and illustrate the participation style of each member.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We believe it is of more benefit to the community to be able to evaluate specific aspects of a persons engagement, rather than have a global score at a glance. Therefore, the goal will be to establish a series of categories for which authorized parties will be able to mint and issue NTTs and NFTs to participants, distribute recognition rewards, and back NFT&#39;s with different assets, effectively developing an accrued score in each of these categories. These categories will be used to define the outer edges of the spiderweb and illustrate where the member sits on this web. Simultaneously, through the Search Bar, one will be able to view “ranked” members in any given category, allowing interested parties to filter for the type of engagement they value. However, we will categorically avoid weighting and amalgamating these categories into one global score. Once this can be accomplished, electors will be better informed, the elected will be more deservedly selected, and degrees of misplaced trust avoided. This will also facilitate the growth of Repu-Fi, where members will be able to leverage and monetize their reputations in the ecosystem, and in so doing, objectively defining the value that is being harnessed within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The underlying code for NFT/NTT minting, distribution, and filtering will be open sourced along with much more which will allow for others to replicate their own reputation systems, as well as scale this one to serve a community much larger than Eden. We win together.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/ede7115d-f394-40f7-97f0-ebbb4a1df66d.png\"></p>",

"summary": "Proposal to create tools for Hugging Face users to augment their datasets while creating fair jobs for digital workers, creating a new microtasking platform that can benefit the machine learning community and help with the adoption of EOS.",
"description": "<h2>Description</h2><p>At Effect Network, we are building a decentralized microtasking platform that can be used by people worldwide. The platform is regulated and administered by Effect DAO: a microtasking platform for the people by the people. The mission of Effect Network is to democratize the microtasking industry. Furthermore, each microtask is a set of transactions on the EOS blockchain, ensuring transparency for both micro taskers and microtask uploaders.</p><p>Enter stage left; we have Hugging Face. Hugging Face is an American company that helps developers create, manage and share datasets to train machine learning models. GitHub is for code and software development, and Hugging Face is for datasets and AI development. Thousands of datasets are available on Hugging Face, and more are added daily. Their mission is to create a platform to help democratize machine learning models.</p><p>The Good: All of us have experienced how great AI models have become this past year, from Stable Diffusion to ChatGPT. Interacting with these AI-powered applications makes it immediately obvious how they’re making certain tasks more accessible and better to work with.</p><p>The Bad: All of these models are owned and controlled by Multi-Billion dollar private corporations that aren’t concerned with sharing the knowledge, open source, adding to the wealth of public domain knowledge, and keeping their data and machine learning models private.</p><p>The Ugly: It gets worse; for these multi Billion-Dollar companies to do the data labeling necessary to create these AI models, they exploit labor arbitrage worldwide to do the work required to develop these precious models. This article came out not too long ago, highlighting how Kenyan workers are paid 2 dollars an hour to sit behind a computer and label data for OpenAI:<a href=\"https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/</a>.</p><p>Now that we have a more in-depth understanding of the current context of how ML models are created at the very nascent stage of the AI industry, we can take a look at the public good that this grant wants to tackle. We believe that we can create value for multiple communities if this project is successful.</p><p>On the one hand, there is an ever-growing need from the AI community for vast amounts of High-quality datasets. Millions, if not Billions, of data parameters, are needed to create a high-quality model such as ChatGPT.</p><p>With this proposal, we want to integrate Hugging Face and Effect Network. We can create a valuable tool for the Hugging Face community to augment, refine and repair their datasets.</p><p>Because of the volume of data required to train these datasets, and each data point is a microtask, we can create a lot of work for digital workers that large projects on Hugging Face and other AI companies are willing to pay for. Finally, all the source code used for this project will be open-source, and available to anyone who wants to further build on this work to create more jobs.</p><p>Finally, this can also benefit the EOS community. Having such an application running on the EOS, blockchain can attract plenty of new users to the EOS ecosystem. The Hugging Face Community and the Machine learning community are growing daily, and we believe that our use case can attract said communities.</p><p><br></p><h2>Deliverables</h2><h3>First deliverable: $3000</h3><p>First off, we will have to prove the project&#39;s usefulness. This will start by building an Effect Network campaign that will be used as an interface for the Effect Network workers to augment existing datasets on Hugging Face. </p><p>This will also require a backend that will post tasks to Effect Force periodical, the following dataset will be used: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-art\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-art</a></p><p>This project is headed by Laion.AI <a href=\"https://laion.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://laion.ai/</a>, the blurb from their website is as follows:</p><p><em>“Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network. TRULY OPEN AI. 100% NON-PROFIT. 100% FREE. LAION, as a non-profit organization, provides datasets, tools, and models to liberate machine learning research. By doing so, we encourage open public education and more environment-friendly use of resources by reusing existing datasets and models.”</em></p><p>Not only do they have large datasets on Hugging Face, but they are also proponents of an open-source culture that lines up well with the core values of Effect Network and EOS as open-source platforms.</p><p>By creating a successful use case with Laion’s dataset, we can publicize to the Hugging Face community that Effect Network is a valid and reliable service for their data augmentation needs.</p><p>These first tasks will need to be funded, and the amount of EFX per task will be low to test this first batch. </p><p><br></p><h5>Technologies:</h5><p>We will use a <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vue</a> micro-frontend for the <a href=\"https://developer.effect.network/effect_network/template.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effect Network Campaign Template</a>. For the backend, we will be using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Express</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">HuggingFaceJS</a>, and other Node.js tools. </p><p><br></p><h3>Second Deliverable: $1000</h3><p>With this deliverable, we will focus on creating a proper validation and qualification system. This will be needed to ensure the quality of the task results. Microtasking platforms are often the target of users trying to scam the platform. </p><p>We will have to build a Qualification Campaign for Workers to take and prove that they are capable and knowledgeable enough to be able to do the work required of augmenting the datasets. </p><p>Afterward, we have to build out a few features to expand the <a href=\"https://github.com/effectai/valiation-bot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/effectai/valiation-bot</a> to include the features necessary to validate the Qualification Campaign for the workers. </p><p><br></p><h3>Third deliverable: $3000</h3><p>The next deliverable will be an Effect Network dApp to create a frontend that the hugging face community can use to buy dataset augmentation for their projects. This deliverable will include integration with Hugging Face to make the whole process smoother for any Hugging Face user to purchase data augmentation tasks.</p><p>It might be useful to explain here first what an Effect Network dApp is. An Effect Network dApp is a web application that allows users to purchase a microtask without owning an Effect Network campaign. All the user needs to do is input the parameters, in this case, the users will select the datasets they would like to be augmented and pay for the expenses for doing these microtasks. 90% of which goes to the workers who do these tasks. </p><p>One example of this is the <a href=\"https://effectai.github.io/dApp-Label-Image/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snapshot Labeler</a>. Users can add URLs to images, so the workforce can label the images. Users upload images, workers label them, and the users get augmented images with the metadata back. </p><h5><br></h5><h5>Technologies:</h5><p>The following GitHub repository will be used as a base to create this Hugging Face dApp: <a href=\"https://github.com/effectai/dApp-Label-Image\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/effectai/dApp-Label-Image</a></p><p>The backend will need to be expanded to include a Database: <a href=\"https://github.com/effectai/dApp-Label-Image\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/effectai/dApp-Label-Image</a></p><p>The backend will also need to be expanded to include features to validate the task results. This is to make sure that workers do not scam the platform. </p><h3><br></h3><h3>Fourth deliverable: $5000</h3><p>The broader goal of this project would be to include other datasets and machine learning communities such as Kaggle. This would include the tools created for the Hugging Face community, with a campaign for the Effect Network microtasking platform and dApp that the Kaggle community can use to upload and augment their datasets. This will include the first three deliverables outlined above but for Kaggle. </p><h2><br></h2><h2>About me</h2><p>Heading this project will be me, David Britt.

"description": "<h4>Decentralized IDs (DIDs) and Verified Credentials (VCs) are revolutionary technologies that empower individuals to have full control over their own digital identities, without relying on centralized authorities. DIDs provide a new model for identifiers that are self-sovereign, while VCs enable the secure and privacy-preserving exchange of claims. Together, they form the backbone of modern, user-centric identity systems. Now that EOS has the EVM, it&#39;s time to bring this transformative technology to the EOS ecosystem.</h4><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Public Good</strong></h3><p>Our project serves as a public good by enhancing the security, privacy, and user control of digital identities on the EOS blockchain. It directly benefits the EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h3><p>Current identity management solutions on EOS lack the robustness and user-centric features that Decentralized IDs and Verified Credentials offer.</p><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3><p>We plan to deploy a smart contract on EOS, based on an open-source Polygon ID framework, for handling DIDs and VCs. Our issuer node, will allow authenticated users to issue and manage credentials. Additionally, we will develop a fully custom-made Polygon ID Verifier for both on-chain and off-chain verification.</p><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Outcomes for This Season</strong></h3><ul><li>Deployment of DID and VC smart contract on EOS</li><li>Integration with our open-source issuer node</li><li>Development and deployment of the custom-made Polygon ID Verifier</li><li>User interface for credential management</li></ul><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p>All EOS users will benefit from enhanced security and control over their digital identities. The issuer node and smart contract, based on open-source frameworks, will enable more secure and versatile credential issuance. The custom-made Polygon ID Verifier will provide a seamless, customized, and privacy-based authentication experience.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Public Good Usability</strong></h3><p>The deployed smart contract, issuer node, and custom-made Polygon ID Verifier can be utilized by other developers and organizations for various applications, including identity verification and secure data sharing.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Delivery Plan and Timeline</strong></h3><ul><li>Smart Contract Deployment: Month 1</li><li>Issuer Node Integration: Month 2</li><li>Custom-Made Polygon ID Verifier Development: Month 3</li><li>UI Development: Month 4</li></ul><p><br></p><h3><strong>Team Members</strong></h3><ul><li>Xavier Fernandez, Lead Developer</li><li>Leister Alvarado, Blockchain Analyst</li><li>Edwin Rodriguez, UI/UX Designer</li><li>Andres Gomez, Security Researcher</li></ul><h4><br></h4><h3><strong>Long-Term Goals</strong></h3><p>To become the go-to solution for identity management on EOS and other blockchains.

Posting on Twitter is free, but when an EOS thread picks up a lot of attention, it’s worth doubling down on that success and paying to promote the tweet to maximize exposure and reach new potential market entrants. Moreover, giveaways/contests can be leveraged to expose more people to the EOS ecosystem and generate more momentum. As an example, there could be an “EVM MEME CONTEST” where the winner gets $500 in EOS, that coincides with the debut of EVM to create an organic hype machine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community Involvement is Key</strong></p><p>Many of your may know me from the EOS telegram groups in which I am active.

Continued community support through this grant means an even more robust art and editorially rich final product. </p><p><br></p><p>Ideally, issue one would have been released before the end of Pomelo Season 3, but that deadline will lapse by just a few weeks. Issue #1, episode #1 will be available by the end of August in multiple formats including a sharable, embeddable edition, a downloadable edition and a print edition. Issue #1, episode #2 will be available in the same formats by the end of September. Both issues will be 16 pages.</p><p><br></p><p>Your support during Pomelo Season 3 ensures the talent, hiring and resources needed for Immutable Realms to reach thousands of potential new EOS and Eden members.

"description": "<p>EOS Light Node is an eosio node implementation developed by golang. Unlike the full node of eosio based on nodeos, the node by eos-light-node only verify the block header of the eosio chain, and the actions in block will not be executed. So the light nodes have low requirements for operating environment.</p><p><br></p><p>EOSIO&#39;s block header structure supports lightweight nodes, but currently there is no reliable lightweight node implementation in the EOSIO community. In the EOSIO network, a full node has very high requirements for machine performance, network, and operation maintenance. At present, there are very few full nodes available in the EOSIO network. This means that the current EOSIO network structure is strongly centralized, which has a big impact to stability, and also makes it harder to develop and deploy DAPP on the chain.</p><p><br></p><p>Although EOSIO&#39;s plugin architecture can allow nodes to expand functions, nodes have higher requirements for machine performance. At the same time, developing plugins based on C ++ requires high development thresholds. Therefore, EOSIO has few expansion tools, which indirectly make development of DAPP more difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>At present, an important direction of chain development is to support cross-chain. EOSIO supports adding side chains based on IBC. IBC needs to be based on full nodes so that users can obtain the proof data which based on the merkle tree. However, due to the high cost of a full node, it is unrealistic to require a small number of validators and phishers to start a full node. This will make some theoretical support schemes can not work well as it is uneconomical. If all services only provided by full nodes, then the entire system will be very vulnerable.</p><p><br></p><p>To sum up the above problems, we need a sufficiently lightweight EOSIO node implement.Light nodes should be easy to expand and secondary development and ensure the verification of the blocks.</p><p><br></p><p>Now i have complete the First Version of eos light node, in next step, we will do this:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Improve block storage implementation to be compatible with nodeos&#39; block db</li><li>Implement irreversible block determination algorithm consistent with nodos</li><li>Support other nodes to synchronize blocks and transactions from light nodes</li><li>Improve API interface to be as compatible as possible with nodeos</li><li>Optimize concurrent computing capabilities and speed up the synchronization process</li><li>Support eos-vm for the implementation of some actions</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The M1 Grant requested: USD 10k, to develop the eos light node to support:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Improve block storage implementation.</li><li>Improve API interface like the history plugin to get the block and trx from eos chain</li></ul>",

"summary": "After helping translate Dan Larimer's groundbreaking book to German (2021), I am excited to announce my new project to create a high quality Audiobook with the aim to spread Dan's vision to even more German speaking people out there!",
"description": "<p> </p><h1>High Quality <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71o8359li0s&amp;list=PLf_xIvPM3ermdpmePabPbwls96YCkqg2r&amp;ab_channel=MarkusHinrichs\" rel=\"nofollow\">German Audiobook</a> of <em>More Equal Animals</em> - <em>Gleichere Tiere</em></h1><p> </p><p>Many people, not only members of the EOS, EDEN on EOS or ƒractally community consider <a href=\"https://moreequalanimals.com/posts/book-launch\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>More Equal Animals</em></a> by Daniel Larimer as a <strong>must read</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>In his book Dan talks about the systemic problems our current governance systems are facing and shows <strong>possible solutions to these seemingly impossible problems</strong>. His eye-opening book empowers readers with information and wisdom and demonstrates a path out of despair!</p><p> </p><p>Dan’s book provided readers with the necessary spark to break free from their shells and take action, turning them from passive to active. This is the reason I think it needs to be read (or heard) by more people. MEA, in my opinion, is excellent in this sense. People must realise it’s time to wake up and take responsibility for their role in the modern world. It’s the primary reason that I, and members of the German EOS Community translated it in the first place.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why an Audiobook?</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Many time-constrained individuals opt to listen to podcasts and audiobooks as an adjunct to reading. I choose this format for this reason. Chuck MacDonald&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xepUoQbOzr4&amp;ab_channel=MarkScheer-earthman\" rel=\"nofollow\">English audiobook of More Equal Animals</a> has thousands of <em>views</em> on YouTube. I&#39;m hoping that the German-speaking community will enjoy this audiobook as well.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Format</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Because some people like listening to audiobooks and podcasts while travelling to work or while preparing dinner at home, this audiobook will be made available for free on YouTube and other podcasting platforms in a playlist of brief episodes (max 10 minutes each).</p><p><br></p><h4><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71o8359li0s&amp;list=PLf_xIvPM3ermdpmePabPbwls96YCkqg2r&amp;ab_channel=MarkusHinrichs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit the project’s Youtube channel to listen to the first episodes</a></h4><h4><br></h4><p>The entire audiobook will be available for free download and listening as soon as its ready..</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Status, timeframe and financing</strong></h2><p> </p><p>I began this project in June 2022, and now attempt to record new material as time permits. I want people to enjoy listening to this audiobook.It’s difficult to estimate, but I believe that recording, editing, and platform preparation will require roughly 50-80 working hours. (I didn&#39;t include mastering since I would hire a professional audio studio when there&#39;s enough funding.) My dear friend and EDEN member Lukas Mantinger (@sagarmathanp), who initially funded the translation project of More Equal Animals into German (<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/moegerman\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomelo.io/grants/moegerman</a>), pre-funded this project with 600 EOS.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Giving to this project supports the fractal democratic process as a public good for increasing participation across on EOS, the greater community and individual empowerment. There is a great deal of opportunity since there are more than 170 million native German speakers worldwide.</p><p> </p><p>Here is a link to the first 5 episodes of this project on my YouTube channel. Joachim Planer, a well-known artist and good friend of mine, contributed some of his fantastic soundscapes to this endeavour (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2t6m0VGDi1lSCLVR2avJzl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joachim Planer on Spotify</a>).</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71o8359li0s&amp;list=PLf_xIvPM3ermdpmePabPbwls96YCkqg2r&amp;ab_channel=MarkusHinrichs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to the “Gleichere Tiere-Playlist” on Youtube</a></p>",

"description": "<p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/6cd97c87-66e6-4ff8-92c5-2dc8fba26284.png\" width=\"655\"></p><h2><br></h2><h2>TL;DR</h2><p><br></p><p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> to create a simple, elegant way for people to move tokens into and out of any Antelope EVM (i.e., an EVM bridge for EOS and Telos, with the potential to add EVMs to other Antelope chains in the future).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefit to Users:</strong> in-wallet access to an easy-to-use interface to bridge between the native Antelope tokens and EVM tokens. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefit to Developers:</strong> it will remove a barrier to entry for dApp adoption, making the EOS and Telos EVMs more attractive places to build new projects. Unicove is also open-source, so if developers wanted to apply the same EVM bridge model to their own projects, they could do so.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who We Are: </strong>Greymass is an expert team of researchers and developers who have been with the EOS network since day 1, helping to launch the network with eos-voter (which later became Anchor). We’ve been contributing to the network as block producers and product developers ever since. Learn more about us at <a href=\"http://greymass.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://greymass.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why build an EVM bridge in Unicove?</h2><p><br></p><p>Right now, both the EOS and Telos networks have a fully functional EVMs. This is great, because it gives the network a chance to attract developers and innovative projects that can be built in Solidity, a more well-known smart contract language than Antelope’s C++. </p><p><br></p><p>But having the EVM is only half the battle. Now that it’s here, the network needs supporting infrastructure – tools that make it easier for both users and developers to engage with the EVM. We believe that easy-to-use EVM bridges (i.e., ways to swap Antelope-based tokens to EVM-based tokens) are a crucial part of this infrastructure, because they allow users to access tokens that they can use in EVM-based dApps. This bridge will serve as Unicove&#39;s first EVM-based feature as we continue to explore how best it can serve the Antelope ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>While the network currently has a free-standing bridge courtesy of the ENF, we want to lower the barrier to entry by putting an EVM bridge directly in our Unicove web wallet. This will give more users the opportunity to swap tokens, since all Unicove users will have direct access without having to leave their wallet.</p><p><br></p><h2>Why trust Greymass to build it?</h2><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>We have extensive experience building wallets for the EOS community.</strong> Our very first product for the network was a wallet, and we’ve kept the legacy going. Today, we offer two wallet products: the Anchor wallet (available for iOS, Android, and desktop!) and the Unicove web wallet. With the lessons we’ve learned along the way, we feel confident that we can deliver a user-friendly EVM bridge within the Unicove wallet.</li><li><strong>This isn’t our first rodeo. </strong>Feel free to look up our past Pomelo pitches – we’ve now participated in multiple Pomelo seasons, and every time, we’ve delivered on our promises.</li><li><strong>Greymass is an Antelope-native company. </strong>Having been with the network since Day 1, we’re committed to helping EOS and the Antelope ecosystem succeed. We’re passionate about distributed ledger technology, and using it to help lift up the communities we’re a part of. </li></ol>",

"description": "<p>Hello everyone, I am Hazuke. During the 2022 Spring Festival, I joined EOS Bees and became the manager of Chinese Division. I started independently translating some high-quality articles about EOS and collaborated with community member SHE to translate BM&#39;s Fractally Governance white paper.</p><p><br></p><p>On March 7, 2022, I launched the operation of this Weibo account by posting my first self created <a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/7540111017?tabtype=newVideo&amp;layerid=4744404743487884\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOS promotional video</a>. As of June 12, 2023, I have published a total of 456 pieces of content, including the weekly and monthly reports of the EOS Foundation, some individual independent opinions on EOS, more than 30 EOS related articles independently translated by individuals, such as the Hackathon contest held by ENF and the technical science popularization of EOS EVM, etc. All content has over 4 million views.</p><p><br></p><p>The account currently has 832 followers, although the number is not large, I can confidently say that we are the Chinese EOS social media account with the highest fan activity, including other social media platform. Among them, there are many Weibo influencers with millions of followers, because the content I post is timely and of high quality.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it is very necessary to establish a position belonging to EOS on Weibo, the largest social media platform in Asia. Every content I post will have many fan comments and likes, including loyal EOS enthusiasts and of course, anti-fans. For fans who have questions, I will patiently answer them. When facing insults, I have always adhered to the principle of not defaming and tried my best to communicate positive energy with them. I believe we need a window to maintain communication with various EOS users.</p><p><br></p><p>At present, I am fully focused on the EOS ecosystem. I have played various roles in the community, including game developer (PINK MEOW), media evangelist, and community translator. With limited energy, I hope to receive financial support from the community, so I can contribute to community construction more calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>If I can receive donations from the community, I will strive to achieve the following:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Ensure that 2 high-quality EOS articles are translated and exclusive EOS articles are written every week.</p><p>2. Increase the number of Weibo followers to over 1000 and strive towards 3000.</p><p>3. Share more personal independent thinking content about EOS and create cultural barriers in the Chinese EOS community.</p><p>4. preach in other comprehensive encryption communities on Weibo , eliminate bias and misunderstandings, and promote EOS to a wider range of encryption users.</p><p>5. Try organizing offline cultural salons and community activities in my own city (Wuhan) to achieve the goal of offline communication among real users.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, thank you for your understanding and support. If EOS is not yet strong enough, let&#39;s work together to make it stronger. Empty talk is cheap, let&#39;s work together to build it!</p>",

We will document our process so that it can be used by other businesses that are interested in engaging their employees and community in governance and shareholding. We will share this model in our regional network, and we hope that it can also inspire the EOS communities around the world to deploy the power of blockchain technology to their local economies.</p><p><br></p><h3>Historic: </h3><p>We have spent the last 3 years developing “Le Comptoir St-Vrac” (CSV), a self-service and self-managed grocery store in a rural community in Québec, Canada. We develop regenerative systems, revitalizing local economies and empowering food sovereignty through various initiatives.</p><p><br></p><p>In autumn 2021, we started to accept EOS as a payment method for our local members. We saw the potential for connecting our shareholding investment system to the EOS BlockChain, for more transparency and to facilitate investment by community members and employees. </p><p><br></p><p>We see the potential of bringing the flexibility and governance strength of crypto to projects in the physical world at the local level, and sharing what we are doing so that the global community can benefit from it.</p><p><br></p><h3>Issues tackled:</h3><p>// Provide an alternative business structure for collective enterprises that recognizes the contribution of each and give the ownership back to the people at the core of the operations.</p><p>// Reduce the legal costs of implementing dynamic ownership of businesses</p><p>// Reduce the barrier of entry of static ownership of businesses and responsibility on the shoulders of a few</p><p>// Tackles the issue of one person / one vote of cooperatives, while people clearly have different levels of involvement</p><p><br></p><h4>Our expertise: </h4><p>– Regenerative and permaculture design</p><p>– Revitalizing local communities</p><p>– Self-managed system and shared governance</p><p>– Designing and documenting participative process</p><p>– Social and economic innovation</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Our core values:</h4><p>transparency, autonomy, resilience, regeneration and cultivating various forms of capital </p><p><br></p><h3>Roadmap</h3><h3>Season 1)<strong> </strong>The work we did before knowing about Pomelo</h3><p><br></p><p><strong>The foundations to the participative business model</strong></p><p>Developing and prototyping an internal system calculating the monthly investment of employees and contributors to the “Comptoir St-Vrac”.

Owners of private castles sometimes gave servants some silver coins to encourage and commend their thoughtful service.</p><p>Since the 18th century, bowls with the words &#34;to insure prompt service&#34; can be seen on the dining tables of London hotels.</p><p>Customers drop their change into the bowl and are served quickly and attentively by the hostess. And by connecting the first letters of the above English words, it becomes the abbreviation &#34;tips&#34;, which is translated as tip.</p><p>Gradually, tips evolved into a fixed word in people&#39;s mouths, and giving tips after receiving services also began to develop into a specific consumer culture in Western countries.</p><p>Tipping culture is one of the common social behaviors in the world. What we have to do today is to transfer the offline tipping culture to the blockchain. Based on blockchain, smart contracts, distributed accounting, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized databases, it has special attributes such as decentralization, traceability, non-tamperability, and quasi-anonymity to solve the trust problem of transaction services.</p><p>tips on eos is a Dapp on the eos chain.

Oppose obtain without effort, make the real workers get paid,</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Goal</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Prove the correctness and inevitability of the philosophy of V-POW on the EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Distribution method</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Completely reproduce the Bitcoin mining method, using a virtual proof of work mechanism.The total amount of tokens is 10 billion, and the smart contract issues 40 tokens per second to the mining pool. The issuance is halved every 4 years, and each mining gets 1/10,000 tokens. And in the future, the virtual mining pool mode will be opened. The whales could establish a virtual mining pool by staking tokens, attract newcomers to enter their own virtual mining pool for mining, and extract handling fees.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Economic model</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Bitcoin establishes the currency price by burning electricity, while WEBX V-POW enters the repurchase pool by saving EOS the miners sent(centralized automatic execution in the smart contract area). According to the algorithm (executed between 1EOS and 128EOS, this value will be adjusted according to the progress of the project), the repurchase pool is all used to repurchase the project tokens on the EOS DEFI platform to increase the value of the tokens. 50% of the repurchased tokens will be destroyed, and 50% will enter the co-management library of the stakers. Destroy the contract, everyone can call and execute it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Team operating funds</strong></p><p><br></p><p>When the DAO treasury has accumulated enough 100 million WEBX, and the team will withdraw it for publicity, promotion, airdrops and centralized exchanges to provide liquidity. When the DAO treasury has accumulated enough 100 million and before the DAO function goes online, all the repurchased tokens will be destroyed, and the savings will continue after the DAO function goes online. The future DAO treasury will be jointly managed by the top 21 of the stakers through the deployment of smart contracts, and the top 21 can enter the management meeting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DAO model</strong></p><p>  </p><p>Only stakers can participate in the construction of DAO. Only the top 21 stakers have the right to enter the management committee, and any staker has the right to vote.</p><p> </p><p>1.Anyone can propose a plan, such as, what can I provide to the WEBX community, what to accomplish, and how many WEBX tokens are needed. When provisioning and implementation is completed, stakers will vote, and when the vote is passed, the smart contract will automatically release treasury tokens to proposers.</p><p> </p><p>2.Anyone in the management committee will put forward a demand, and the management committee will vote to approve it, publish it in the smart contract and mark the reward amount, and those who are able to realize it can accept the order. When the demand is completed, all stakers will vote to reach a certain voting ratio , you can lend money to the implementer.</p><p> </p><p>In order to prevent sybil attacks by low-cost chips in the early stage, the DAO model will not be opened before the first halving. After the first halving, the smart contract will judge whether the opening requirements are met, (number of participants, token market value and other weights ) The smart contract will automatically enable the DAO function.</p><p><br></p><p>After the mining is stable,the token contract will be open source and black hole. (about a month or so open source, and black hole), after the first halving, the proposal contract will be decentralized in the DAO pool account. Realize a decentralized DAO, put an end to man-made evil, destroy common knowledge, and disrupt market behavior.</p><p><br></p><p>After the first week of operation, it is easy to be arbitraged by arbitrageurs in SWAP-type decentralized exchanges. This project is only suitable for order book-style decentralized exchanges, so it is currently adjusted to be the first one on EOS The order book-style decentralized exchange ALCOR Exchange conducts repurchases. ALCOR has a limit on the number of pending orders, so the smart contract will automatically cancel the old pending orders and merge them into new pending orders based on the average price of these orders. Through the algorithm, it is more fair to ordinary participants to fight against the arbitrary behavior of scientists. The algorithm has multiple repurchase modes. The highest order to the exchange will not exceed 200% of the current mining cost. Generally, it will be between 10 % and 90%. Only when the number of mining continues to drop sharply, the order will Higher than the real-time mining cost, there will be some room for arbitration in this case, but this time lasts for a short time. Under normal Circumstances, inviting more people to mine will increase the repurchase threshold from 10% to 90%.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits to EOS</strong></p><p><br></p><p>1.Absorbing the additional issuance of EOS, any blockchain project is fighting against entropy increase through halving, destruction, and punishment mechanisms, but EOS does not. We love EOS, so we use V-POW mining to fight against it EOS entropy increases.</p><p><br></p><p>2.Facilitate the flow of funds into EOS decentralized exchange projects. All mining fee will eventually flow to the decentralized exchange market-making pool.Let the EOS decentralized exchange regain its popularity, increase the recognition rate and adoption rate of encrypted users, and accelerate the stage of history. Let EOS move from a disordered and uncontrollable state to an orderly one, and let EOS flow into real EOS projects.</p><p><br></p><p>3.Create pressure on the disorderly provider of the system, increase the loss of the system, and increase the negative entropy. We learn from the inspiration of Aidousi, hoping that the mining effect of the project will occupy enough EOS network resources, and form a supervisory role for the main network nodes to upgrade their performance. The EOS system is composed of multiple nodes, and very few irresponsible nodes use low-performance and low-cost servers, which leads to the barrel effect and curbs EOS performance and user experience.</p><p><br></p><p>4.Every one who joining in mining is to reduce the entropy of the EOS system and promote the growth of EOS value.</p><p><br></p><p>5.Joining DAO is expected to collectively recover the defrauded assets in various frauds in the cryptocurrency community and realize decentralized rights protection. (Example: You can offer a million dollar reward to sue a fraudster until he goes bankrupt)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Short-term goals</strong></p><p> </p><p>1.Implementation of V-pool</p><p><br></p><p> The virtual proof of work must correspond to the virtual mining pool at the same time. The top N stakers will become the owner of the mining pool, and deploy the smart contract of the virtual mining pool to attract miners to mine in their own mining pool and extract handling fees. In this way, let users understand the philosophy and participation methods of virtual proof of work.</p><p><br></p><p>2.WebX DAO</p><p> </p><p>WebX DAO is a proposal-issued DAO. To participate in this DAO, you only need to hold and stake webx tokens. This DAO does not need a real name, and it will start when the token distribution reaches a certain level and the market value reaches a certain level (clearly informed that it will not start before the first halving). This DAO is fully decentralized, and its complexity is much higher than that of EOS&#39;s existing DAO projects.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, this DAO is a proposal type, which proposes a task, and all stakers vote to pass the task, lock the tokens, complete the task, and the management will vote to release the tokens.</p><p><br></p><p>3.WebX Stablecoin</p><p> </p><p>WebX will issue stablecoins through a new mechanism. This mechanism has learned the lessons of the failure of various algorithmic stablecoins, and there will be no breaking away from anchoring and liquidation. The new mechanism will be released in a white paper dedicated to stablecoins after the stablecoin project is launched, and the advantages and competitiveness of this mechanism will be explained in detail at that time.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an open source EOS contract that anyone can use.</p><p> </p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/ebb7b7f1-9052-460f-81e7-4ffbec976236.jpg\" width=\"252\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/703a29d4-f9e7-43d9-bf40-aa25507d0dd5.jpg\" width=\"252\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/ea6e3dd9-e412-498e-9035-4d3caaca0440.jpg\" width=\"252\"></p><p><br></p><p>Official website  https://webxmine.com</p><p>Mining DAPP    https://webxminer.com</p><p>GIthub            https://github.com/webxteam</p><p>Telegram         https://t.me/eoswebx</p>",

"description": "<h3>The State of NFTs Right Now</h3><p><br></p><p>Across the entire Crypto community, NFTs are a popular tool to tokenize various things. Artists in particular see NFTs as a great way to tokenize their art and be rewarded for its sale. Unfortunately, with the current state of NFT searches, discovering art that caters to your tastes is hard. When you search for “hat” on the Atomic Hub explorer, you can tell the search is limited to the metadata encoded within the NFT. The actual content of the image is not a factor in a search result. That’s why you can have so few results for something that you would expect to appear much more frequently in a pool of millions of NFTs. This means many artists can create great art, but their art cannot be discovered by as many people because they did not add enough tags to the NFT metadata. The solution to this problem is creating an index of NFT content that can be searched. </p><p><br></p><h3>NFT Image Content Indexer</h3><p><br></p><p>Demo - <a href=\"https://djstrikanova.github.io/nft-indexer-searchkit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://djstrikanova.github.io/nft-indexer-searchkit/</a></p><p><br></p><p>Searchkit Router - <a href=\"https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer-router\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer-router</a></p><p>Searchkit FrontEnd - <a href=\"https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer-searchkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer-searchkit</a></p><p>Python Indexer Scripts - <a href=\"https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/djstrikanova/nft-indexer</a></p><p><br></p><p>HuggingFace is a company dedicated to helping foster open-source AI research and development. It is a hub with many models and datasets people can use in their own projects. For image recognition, there are many models that help analyze an image’s content. You can see an example here<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2</a></p><p><br></p><p>Creating an index of NFT content and making it searchable requires these following components:</p><p><br></p><h4>1. Scanning</h4><p><br></p><p>There needs to be a way to collect the constantly expanding list of NFTs and the corresponding urls to their content. Scanning will require a bot that can build a dataset of all existing NFTs and periodically grab new NFTs generated since the last scan.</p><p><br></p><h4>2. Analysis</h4><p><br></p><p>There needs to be a tool that processes NFT linked content and logs the result into an expanding database. This would involve using a model available on HuggingFace. In practice, this would be a python script that can be run locally with a personally owned GPU doing the computation for the analysis that generates all the tags for an image.</p><p><br></p><h4>3. Storage</h4><p><br></p><p>There needs to be a database that can be queried for searching this index. I think using Elasticsearch would work best for creating a searchable database.</p><p><br></p><h4>4. Search</h4><p><br></p><p>There needs to be a public site that EOS users can access to query the index when doing searches. Facings has a great NFT collection manager tool. A plugin for the collection manager can be made such that the Explorer can query Elasticsearch instances with the content index, making NFTs much easier to search.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/FACINGS/collection-manager\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FACINGS/collection-manager</a></p><p><br></p><p>I whipped up a Demo using SearchKit, but for Season 6 I would like to focus on upgrading it to use InstantSearch.js instead.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>What is the Public Good?</h3><p><br></p><p>The goal of this project will be to create Github repositories that satisfy all the above components and can be easily forked for modification. The first repository will provide a resource for anyone who wants to generate their own NFT content indexes. This repository will have an “MIT” license. For this project the initial target NFT dataset will be all the EOS NFTs that can be found on AtomicHub. A second repository will be a fork of the Facings collection manager tool, modified such that it can be a plugin which allows search queries to be done on Elasticsearch instances with NFT content. This fork will maintain the “GNU” license of the collection manager. While the Facings Collection Manager is being updated for plugin capability another repo published will be an open-source front-end demo that allows users to explore all the NFTs indexed. </p><p><br></p><p>With a proper base for these components, the NFTs being analyzed won’t need to be limited to purely image content. By swapping in different models from HuggingFace, the genre of music in a song, the summary of a text file, or the content of a video can all be potential targets for indexing. With the scanning component, one would just need to update the scan to a different source to build up another dataset. NFTs tend to be pointers to content elsewhere, and being able to search through that content can be very useful. For many blockchains, discovering interesting NFT’s in a sea of millions upon millions is difficult.

The EVM can help begin to connect EOS to these larger art communities and support culturally relevant art via UNDRGRND.</p><p><br></p><p>NFTs help preserve culture through immutability.

UNDRGRND gives the artists the platform, resources, and opportunity to be heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Examples of artists telling their stories via UNDRGRND: <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-deniz-izadi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deniz Izadi</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-desh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Desh</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-mentalnoise\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mentalnoise</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-jordi-gandul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jordi Gandul</a> and <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/tag/%23UNDRGRND+ARTIST\" rel=\"nofollow\">more</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to early support, discovery and feature articles many of UNDRGRND&#39;s artists have gone on to find even greater successes on larger platforms to a broader audience, allowing for their stories to spread and be heard by the masses that would have otherwise gone unheard.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2><p>Founded in November 2021, UNDRGRND began publishing a weekly feature titled UNDRGRND DIGS. The premise was simple: highlight five deserving artists not appearing on large gated platforms that should be seen by a larger audience and buy their work. Over the course of two years, by providing context to the art, elevating the exposure of the artist, and purchasing their art, UNDRGRND helped over 300 artists grow their audience, reach new collectors, appear in a gallery of an established art brand, and bring in new collectors for financial support.</p><p><br></p><p>UNDRGRND also provides education for a new generation of art collectors. With no central hub for information, collectors and artists must crowd-source knowledge and experiences to learn the nature of the crypto art world. This sharp learning curve fractures audiences and creators, waiting to be discovered. Connecting the artist with collectors remains the key to success. Entire communities focus on this one aspect in the crypto social media sphere. These communities often lack resources and consist of artists collecting from other artists. This unsustainable model of artists supporting artists requires capital from outside sources. The UNDRGRND publication establishes a starting point for novice art collectors and much-needed support for artists with marketing and credibility.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/157755e0-7261-48f5-9540-50ea0434d7bb.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The inception of cryptocurrency and crypto art was a response to the traditional ideals in the financial and art markets that for years remained gated and served an elite few. What was promised was a more democratic, community-driven market. What has transpired has been more of what was rejected in the old world. UNDRGRND focuses on empowering the community, incentivizing them to discover, recommend, and participate in helping curate. Many amateur collectors, or NFT consumers, balk at the idea of purchasing art due to the fear of &#34;not knowing art&#34;. Art is subjective and anyone can learn when given free access to information and context. UNDRGRND cultivates equitable opportunities with the belief that art if you can articulate why you like a work of art, then you can become an art collector. By removing stigmas, qualifications, and expert opinions many more feel empowered to collect art and support their favorite artists.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/b1fc8c10-d5b8-4abc-913d-0ca9c9b52dfe.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>While many other art-centric platforms ask artists to apply and celebrate the top-performing artists, UNDRGRND will be an open platform, focused on highlighting yet-to-be-recognized artists. Through education, demystifying traditional art ideals, and providing access to effective, honest marketing, UNDRGRND can onboard a new audience of artists and collectors to the EOS ecosystem. Rallying the UNDRGRND community around an open marketplace, UNDRGRND can begin to expand its support of even more artists waiting to be discovered and become someone&#39;s new favorite artist.</p><p>Art and culture generate ideas that spark new life and growth. UNDRGRND can begin to lay the foundation for a new era of EOS.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/a673c2b3-6d13-4033-ba6b-9f86dec7eb94.jpg\"></p>",

Unlike the full node of eosio based on nodeos, the node by eos-light-node only verify the block header of the eosio chain, and the actions in block will not be executed. So the light nodes have low requirements for operating environment.</p><p><br></p><p>EOSIO&#39;s block header structure supports lightweight nodes, but currently there is no reliable lightweight node implementation in the EOSIO community. In the EOSIO network, a full node has very high requirements for machine performance, network, and operation maintenance. At present, there are very few full nodes available in the EOSIO network. This means that the current EOSIO network structure is strongly centralized, which has a big impact to stability, and also makes it harder to develop and deploy DAPP on the chain.</p><p><br></p><p>Although EOSIO&#39;s plugin architecture can allow nodes to expand functions, nodes have higher requirements for machine performance. At the same time, developing plugins based on C ++ requires high development thresholds. Therefore, EOSIO has few expansion tools, which indirectly make development of DAPP more difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>At present, an important direction of chain development is to support cross-chain. EOSIO supports adding side chains based on IBC. IBC needs to be based on full nodes so that users can obtain the proof data which based on the merkle tree. However, due to the high cost of a full node, it is unrealistic to require a small number of validators and phishers to start a full node. This will make some theoretical support schemes can not work well as it is uneconomical. If all services only provided by full nodes, then the entire system will be very vulnerable.</p><p><br></p><p>To sum up the above problems, we need a sufficiently lightweight EOSIO node implement.Light nodes should be easy to expand and secondary development and ensure the verification of the blocks.</p><p><br></p><p>Now i have complete the First Version of eos light node, in next step, we will do this:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Improve block storage implementation to be compatible with nodeos&#39; block db</li><li>Implement irreversible block determination algorithm consistent with nodos</li><li>Support other nodes to synchronize blocks and transactions from light nodes</li><li>Improve API interface to be as compatible as possible with nodeos</li><li>Optimize concurrent computing capabilities and speed up the synchronization process</li><li>Support eos-vm for the implementation of some actions</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The M1 Grant requested: USD 10k, to develop the eos light node to support:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Improve block storage implementation.</li><li>Improve API interface like the history plugin to get the block and trx from eos chain</li></ul>",

Moreover, giveaways/contests can be leveraged to expose more people to the EOS ecosystem and generate more momentum.

And we are going to gradually expand to projects supported by Pomelo or ENF.</p><p><br></p><p>The number of reports we will provide to the community will be determined by the number of grants we received. Reports will be available in both English and Chinese, and may be available in other languages depending on community demand.</p><p><br></p><p>We will work in the following order.</p><p>1. Project reports for Chinese teams supported by Pomelo</p><p>2. Project reports for teams in other languages supported by Pomelo</p><p>3. Project reports for projects or working groups supported by ENF</p><p><br></p><p>Click here for the reports we wrote for EdenCN&#39;s first election&#39;s winning projects.</p><p><a href=\"https://edencn.notion.site/EdenCN-20220530-3bcf734f1b844544b23a794d49b238fd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://edencn.notion.site/EdenCN-20220530-3bcf734f1b844544b23a794d49b238fd</a></p>",

We’ll share this short, snappy zine and give you a copy to read online, or print out and show off.</p><p> </p><p>We’ll even produce special interviews and bonus digital content with members of the Antelope Coalition to dive deeper into crucial topics.</p><p> </p><p>The Antelope community will get quality, easily readable coverage and commentary on all the latest developments from the Antelope Coalition. We need your help and donations to let us bring the info you need on the future of Antelope with The Chronicle!</p><p><br></p><p>Our first Pomelo Season gave us the funds we needed to start working on the Chronicle. We pivoted to a zine to stretch out what we could do with our budget and because we realised we wanted to create something that could be digital and physical. </p><p><br></p><p>We plan to release the first issue in digital format during S4 of Pomelo. We want to take the time to make this first issue shine, so stay tuned as we launch the first Chronicle!</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s what we’ve been working on so far:</p><p><br></p><p>Visually, we chose retro science fiction art.

"description": "<p><strong>Key points</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use: </strong>provide a variety of staking strategies to EOS users and project teams for more yields</p><p><strong>2. Open source: </strong>smart contract library resource helping other EOS project team to build single-token staking reward system</p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost: </strong>attract inactive EOS tokens which will prosper ecosystem</p><p> </p><p><strong>Vault Protocol Introduction</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/vault\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vault protocol is the first single-token lossless yield protocol launched by Defibox. (https://eos.defibox.io/vault) </a>Users can earn corresponding token income by depositing tokens. The assets can be flexibly deposited and withdrawn with open and transparent on chain data. Valut income mainly comes from Defibox protocol income, Yield+ rewards, BP income, REX income, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the utility, the protocol will issue a standard EOS token called sToken, which represents a deposit certificate. sToken can be used in multiple DeFi protocols to obtain more benefits.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public goods that Vault brings</strong></p><p><strong>1. Public use</strong></p><p>Vault is a decentralized single-token staking for public use. Any user or project team is able to use Vault. For EOS users, it is a very good yield tool to stake your EOS and get some good earning; For project team, it is possible to add your project token as a staking token in the future that will benefit your project and community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Open source</strong></p><p>Vault is a pioneer of decentralized a staking system which can be contributed to EOS smart contract library for the public reference in the later stage. Source code made available upon completion of ENF grant https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/pull/98</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><strong>3. Ecosystem Boost</strong></p><p>Most EOS tokens are not active on chain and this causes a big problem for EOS ecosystem. The ENF Yield+ Program is pointing the right direction - to increase on chain activities, to activate those dead EOS tokens. Vault protocol is moving towards the direction that Yield+ is pointing to. It is a powerful protocol that will attract inactive EOS tokens from CEX which will prosper ecosystem. It is not only taking the lead, but also an inspiration for other project teams when they build their own protocols: how to build a good protocol that has a good economic model which can fit EOS environment, activate on chain activities, win rewards from EOS, and give back to the community.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Funds to raise:</strong></p><p>We hope to get 30,000 USD budget for Vault as development funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional Info:</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/d3e448cf-8962-43d4-bd82-e65a4a128a54.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">💯💥EOS Staking Challenge!</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://eos.defibox.io/lottery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://eos.defibox.io/lottery</a></p><p><br></p><p>🎉Go!

"description": "<h2>EOSGuild is an open platform on EOS that can create a tokenized community, launch tokens and airdrop them.</h2><p><br></p><h3>EOSGuild makes it very easy for anyone to launch social tokens for their community. It&#39;s platform-neutral, meaning tokens can be shared on any social media platform.</h3><h2><br></h2><h2>Public welfare of EOSGuild</h2><p>First of all, EOSGuild is a platform that can be used by any community member. EOSGuild will not charge any fee. EOSGuild is of great help to the new project community to quickly improve the community scale, gather popularity and improve community activity. EOSGuild can create a token with one click and air drop it to community members, greatly improving the cohesion of the community. This is very helpful for emerging communities, teams with relatively few technicians, and can solve some early problems in the community. EOSGuild will be fully open source after it goes online and runs stably, including front-end code, server-side code and contract code, with complete development documentation.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solving methods</h2><ul><li><strong>EOSGuild allows you to mint tokens for the community, airdrop them, create an attribution plan for contributors and to provide a bounty for your DAOs, which can effectively guide you through all the options for minting, airdropping, and attributing tokens for your community.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Create your own social token on a fixed supply, federation curve, or attribution schedule Airdrop social tokens through a unique list of available links or addresses.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Discover and grow their community, communicate with and contribute to other creators.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anyone without a code base can complete the issuance and airdrop of tokens through fixed templates, which greatly simplifies the process of project start-up and enables the start-up of various projects to be completed at the most rapid speed.There are two options. One is to create a fixed supply, enter the token name and logo, and pay a certain amount of gas fee to complete the token issue. The other is to issue tokens in the form of a joint curve, with no fixed supply, and the price of tokens increases with supply, helping to reward early holders of tokens.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/b1496bb2-947e-49f9-88ab-efd787ba72ed.png\" width=\"548\"></p>",

Eden Town Halls provide a helpful platform for community members to promote their work, share their thoughts in inspiring conversations, and enjoy fun times with talented builders. We discuss a wide range of topics, including EOS, Eden, Web3, creativity, and much more. In addition to hosting open discussions, we prepare an exciting agenda in collaboration with our guests and record visually engaging shows with high production value each week. We publish the videos for each episode with attractive artwork and detailed show notes, including timestamps, highlights, and related links. </p><p><br></p><p>Eden Town Halls are hosted by <a href=\"https://dansingjoy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dan Singjoy</a>.

With only one volunteer and limited funding, we have not been able to maintain a consistent release schedule of episodes or allocate many resources towards promoting the town halls. For example, we’ve recorded five stellar shows that have yet to be published since early February, we haven’t had time to promote the show with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCreators_/status/1614458267769372674\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweet</a> since January, and we haven’t had time to produce a short <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCreators_/status/1592379445612281856\" rel=\"nofollow\">video clip</a> since November.</p><p><br></p><p>Eden Town Halls have been greatly increasing in quality with each episode and these meetings have the potential to create immense benefits for all communities in the near future. We have exciting visions to produce dozens of high-quality, educational, and entertaining video clips each week with the power of <a href=\"https://edentownhall.com/37\" rel=\"nofollow\">DAMS</a>. We plan to use the unique benefits of EOS consensus games to pioneer new forms of collaborative video creation, expand our distribution to mainstream audiences, and help everyone cooperate better than ever before.</p><p><br></p><p>With your help, we can raise the funding needed to pay for our expenses and continue the show in a sustainable manner. With additional funding we can hire video editors, content curators, and marketers to help Eden Town Halls reach their full potential. We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming town hall and sharing amazing experiences to empower communities.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your consideration!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>[youtube]F89YOeWb91w[/youtube]",

Even if temporarily obscured by system complexities and misleading marketing, flawed financial models with high leverage risk total breakdown under the stress of market pressures if these systems are built with insufficient collateral asset controls.</p><p> </p><p>As the largest blockchain DEFI projects collapse before our eyes, Maker&#39;s collateralized lending model is proving its staying power. Debt backed with more than enough collateral to cover potential future liquidations is quickly becoming the gold standard. With its DAI stable coin, the Maker DAO saving and lending system is the largest and longest standing collateralized debt-backed stable coin system in blockchain. However, the version of Solidity used in the public code is 0.6.12 - several versions behind the current 0.8.4. What is public is not usable.</p><p> </p><p>Leveraging Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) such as EOS&#39;s TrustEVM or the TelosEVM, any Antelope-based DAPP teams who seek to use elements of the Maker/DAI platform will be able to skip months worth of full time development efforts updating the Maker/DAI repository code. With code that is usable and up-to-date, DAPP teams building on EOS, Telos, ULTRA, WAX, and others will be able to quickly incorporate elements of this most reliable stable coin system into their own DAPP projects.</p><p> </p><p>The Telos FORCE DAO team did not anticipate the massive undertaking of the Maker-fork task when it decided to shift from using LUNA-based VADER - an algorithmic stable coin model - as the foundation for its own FUSD stable coin model in May 2022. It does make sense that the public code of the largest and oldest DeFi DAPPs would be out of date, which is why the effort to update the code will be so valuable to interested DAPP projects.</p><p> </p><p>We URGE all Antelope community members to support this effort, which goes a long way toward ensuring greater financial stability for its own ecosystem DAPPS, as well as those of its sister and side chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you!</p>",

One EOS can be mortgaged into one vote, and one vote can cast a maximum of 30 candidate nodes at the same time. Each candidate node can cast a maximum of 1 vote. Users can change their minds to vote for other candidate nodes at any time, and can apply for the redemption of the mortgaged EOS at any time. Apply for redemption Received after 72 hours.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The development of EOS has been stagnant in the past three years. With the establishment of the EOS Network Foundation, the development of EOS has been on the right track, and many new users have started to invest in EOS again.</h3><h3>At present, the voting rate of the EOS mainnet is around 20%, and the pledge rate of REX is less than 5%. This data is far behind the pledge rate of ETH 2.0. The mechanism of EOS determines that users should put their coins out of the exchanges to vote for the nodes. The higher the voting rate and pledge rate, the more positive for the EOS ecological development.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>Old users have a better understanding of how to vote on EOS and how to pledge EOS into REX. But new users don’t know anything about this, because some media who promoting EOS and some EOS developers have left EOS for too long, and lots of EOS communities have been disbanded, resulting in the lack of various user guides.New users are afraid that their assets will be stolen and phished by phishing websites after withdrawal, so they do not participate in EOS voting.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The voting pools established by each node and proxy are advertised independently. When new users look for new voting pool webpages on the Internet, they may encounter fake voting pools and may be deceived, resulting in loss of assets.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The sponsor of this project has written a novice voting guide, sorted out and collected the addresses of the voting pools of each node. Will be published on social media platforms. Every new EOS user can learn and understand how to safely generate an EOS account, securely store EOS assets and vote for EOS nodes for free.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>If POMELO can raise $10,000. An aggregated voting pool will be developed. Users only need to login to one web page with their EOS wallet, select their favorite node voting pool and voting proxy to vote, and conduct real and effective statistics on voting income. Effectively prevent assets from being transferred by phishing websites. This is a free service that helps new EOS users vote and stake.</h3>",

"description": "<h2>Description:</h2><p><br></p><p>Did you know that data 35,000 feet above earth&#39;s surface is already located directly on chain? The Kanda Weather Group began in Africa and has been launching weather balloons and collecting data from a global network of 22 ground sensors hosted by community members.</p><p><br></p><p>Don&#39;t believe us? Check out our live data on Telos here <a href=\"https://explorer.telos.net/account/ascendweathr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://explorer.telos.net/account/ascendweathr</a></p><p><br></p><p>For two year, we&#39;ve been flying weather balloons and doing educational activities with students in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon to teach university students how to build technologies using LoRaWAN and eosio that close the gaps in climate data coverage that government agencies have failed to fill. To date, we&#39;ve done over 25 demonstration launches using locally sourced materials and 3D-printed payloads.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out our Project Pitch below:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPq4KILNolo</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;ve done several blockchain community events, including hackathons with Taikai and Omdena:</p><p>https://taikai.network/en/kanda-weather-group/hackathons/kanda-weather/overview</p><p>https://omdena.com/blog/weather-balloons-to-predict-rainfall/</p><p><br></p><p>Not only is this weather project a real-world use case for eosio, but it&#39;s also a demonstration of the speed and agility of eosio to host data from real-world sensors called IoT devices. During our research, we&#39;ve seen how most radio technologies use end-to-end encryption for security. This makes a lot of sense in use cases like cellular communication, but what about public weather sensors? Why send it encrypted if you want the data to be open anyway? This is where we think blockchain digital signatures are a perfect fit!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Use of Funds:</h2><ol><li>Twenty weather balloon launches done with our newly set up hydrogen station in Douala, Cameroon</li><li>Analysis of eosio codebase to find how new Mandel p2p protocol can be improved to onboard thousands of IoT devices with poor network connectivity</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>Q&amp;A:</h2><p><br></p><h3>Who are the main team members?</h3><p>My name is Nicolas Lopez and I have 5 years cumulative experience at Boeing and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a software engineer and scientific programmer on the GOES-16 weather satellite. I have a strong professional weather and climate background and am a genesis EOS account holder (guztgmbsgige).</p><p><br></p><p>My colleague Dessap Loic lives in France and is traveling to Cameroon to guide the education activities. He has his own company RobotSave and operates a drone education affiliate called Cameroon Flying Labs. He&#39;s done many technology demonstrations with underserved communities in Africa.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>How does data from the weather sensors get to the blockchain?</h3><p>We use a low-power network called LoRaWAN that transmits temperature, pressure, and humidity data a maximum of 10 kilometers to community gateways. Hundreds of volunteers part of the Helium and TheThingsNetwork communities and help to push the data over the internet. These are IoT enthusiasts who would love to learn about Telos and EOS!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Why does weather data need to be on chain?</h3><p>If every one of the 7.7 billion people checked the weather once every morning, it would mean 90,000 data requests every second! That sort of need for real-time data would benefit from decentralized access. Also, we believe such an important dataset should be open and accessible to everyone. It also has to be fast and easily indexed to determine sensor data quality. We invite community members to utilize our on-chain realtime dataset for their own projects!</p>",

"description": "<p>Project Overview</p><p>This grant proposal stems from the EVMxIdeathon on 14 Nov 2022 with the winning submission for the Web3 category: <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/small-business-accounting-web3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Business Accounting &amp; Web3</a>. <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZpWqqgaRDN7I5hinlSYHFh5_sBAna-52\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video of Ideathon final ceremony web3 winning entry.</a></p><p><br></p><p>This grant provides funding for the development and release of the framework to sync EOS blockchain with QuickBooks Online. Approval of this grant will give access to EOS blockchain to small businesses that are already using QuickBooks and be used standalone to capture blockchain information for accounting purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Overview</p><p>Name: Small Business Accounting &amp; Web3</p><p>Brief Description: Create a framework and syncing solution between EOS blockchain and accounting solutions like QuickBooks and QuickBooks online.</p><p>Relationship to EOSIO: Links Partner (customers, vendors, and employees) to their EOS accounts by syncing these from QuickBooks online (QBO). This will allow the system to track payments sent and received on EOS blockchain into QBO for accounting purposes.</p><p>Reason for Interest: Our sister company, High5Software, has been providing small business solutions that sync to QB for two decades and achieved the highest QB Gold Partner for syncing QB and SME: Service Management Enterprise. Leveraging this expertise will allow us to build a sync platform between EOS blockchain and QBO to provide accurate accounting using the typical base currency of USD. Using price oracles, accurate accounting can be captured into QBO for use for sales tax, income tax and other general accounting practices. This solution will also give small businesses an inexpensive way to receive EOS payments on invoices as well as pay vendors and employees.</p><p>Project Details</p><p>A. Framework: Multi-tenant software framework to enable Web3, EOS modules that sync with QUickBooks Online (QBO) and capability to sync with QB and other accounting solutions.</p><p>B. Partner Accounts: Configure EOS account for all the partners that work with EOS/Web3 including Customers, Vendors/Suppliers/Subcontractors, Employees and the company using the system</p><p>C. tipit Pay: Secure online payment system that can allow EOS payments in addition to traditional Credit Card and ACH payments using various processors. tipit Pay links are added to invoices and emails of invoices. Example: <a href=\"https://pay.tipit.io/home?platform=tipitpayrequest&amp;to=gilsertience&amp;amount=1000&amp;symbol=GIL&amp;contract=gilsertience&amp;memo=But%20why%20not%20tho&amp;precision=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">tipit pay link</a></p><p>D. Web3 Monitoring: Monitor company and partner accounts for transactions that should be captured into the accounting system. This includes payments received into specific EOS accounts, for example receiving Pomelo grant funds and getting invoice payments from customers and sending payments to vendors and employees.</p><p>E. QBO Sync: Sync all transactions to and from EOS blockchain into QBO.</p><p>F. Pricing Oracle: Capture token prices at the time of the transaction for accurate accounting into QBO. For example, if 5 EOS is received from a Pomelo grant at multiple different times, the system will accurately price those transactions into the base currency, typically USD.</p><p><br></p><p>Ecosystem Fit</p><p>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Most teams within the EOS ecosystem are considered &#34;small businesses&#34; and can use this system to accurately handle their accounting for sales tax, income tax and other accounting purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is your target audience? All small businesses and independant contractors that are working with EOS for receiving and sending payments. Also targeted to companies using QBO.</p><p><br></p><p>What need(s) does your project meet? Accurate accounting solution using the most popular small biz accounting system, QuickBooks Online while utilizing EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? There are no solutions known for EOS. There are three solutions on the QBO marketplace that work with other blockchains but none that work with EOS or Antelope chains. FIO blockchain has some related elements such as tracking partner accounts across other blockchains and an invoicing solution, however no QBO syncing is available as far as we know. FIO could possibly be a partner of this solution to allow payment handling on other blockchains such as BTC and ETH however investigation is outside the scope of this grant.</p><p><br></p><p>This grant application is also being submitted to ENF. Please support this pomelo grant to show your support for this project.</p><p><br></p><p>Public Good: Everyone will be given a free system for a limited number of partners. This will allow groups with Pomelo grant owners to utilize the system to track all grants into QuickBooks Online and independent contractors to utilize the system to be paid or send payments. In addition, by providing a system such as this, it will grow the EOS ecosystem the more small businesses that exchange EOS based tokens.</p>",

There are risks of the platform going bankrupt and being regulated.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> The project team lacks a supervision mechanism and lacks an audit of the use of funds.</em></p><p><strong><em>3.</em></strong><em> Investors participating in crowdfunding have no incentive mechanism and are not highly motivated.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em>The work progress of the funded team is not limited.</em></p><p> </p><p>We will use EOS smart contracts to develop a decentralized crowdfunding platform.</p><p> </p><h4>Fund Management Design:</h4><p>Fund management is decentralized and hosted in a smart contract. After the development is completed, our team will give up the transfer authority of the smart contract hosting the funds. Give the authority to the EOS nodes for multi-signature management or black hole. Our team will not have the authority to transfer investors&#39; funds.</p><p> </p><h4>Basic design:</h4><p>Crowdfunding funds will be unlocked in batches depending on investor votes:</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is an open platform where anyone can initiate a project and seek investor support.</em></p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><em>Project teams that accept crowdfunding must set the upper and lower limits of the crowdfunding amount. When the lower limit is reached, the project is deemed to be launched, and the investor&#39;s funds will be locked in the smart contract, waiting to be unlocked in batches. If the expiration date does not exceed the lower limit, the project will be considered a failed crowdfunding. It needs to be restarted and the investor can get his funds (EOS) back from the smart contract.</em></p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><em>Teams that accept crowdfunding must reach the set delivery goals and apply for unlocked funds. Project funds are unlocked in batches, and all investors need to vote through smart contracts to unlock funds to the project team in batches.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em> Investor voting weight is realized through algorithm. The algorithm will find a balance of weights between large and small investors. When a certain turnout is reached, the smart contract will release funds to the project party. The algorithm formula will be fully open sourced on Github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Innovative design:</h4><p>We designed the one-time unlocking mode, which is different from the batch-based unlocking mode.</p><p> </p><p>Project teams that accept crowdfunding can set up a result of working first,then receiving funds. When the project team achieve the goal, then the investors vote to approve it, the crowdfunding funds will be released at one time.This design is for the project team that accepts crowdfunding to make promises and products that are beneficial to investors, and after self-funding to complete the goal, a one-time vote to release all the crowdfunding funds to the project team.This innovative design allows crowdfunding while working. With the progress and development of the project, more and more people will participate in crowdfunding, and the project team will receive more funds at one time.</p><p> </p><h4>Public Goods Section:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is a project that one person can participate in. There is no curtain. Anyone can publish the project and accept crowdfunding. Anyone can become an investor.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> All parts of the project involving smart contracts and algorithms will be open sourced and removed on github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Benefits to the EOS ecosystem:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>Smart contracts are developed and deployed in the main network. Crowdfunding EOS uses EOS as the base currency, and T contains USD on EOS.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em>This crowdfunding platform will first serve the project teams of the EOS community and help EOS projects.

"description": "<p>In the era of cloud storage, the public’s privacy is at risk. Most storage providers encrypt data at rest, but who has the keys? For users who want to take control of their data, Encrinus provides a free application that allows them to encrypt data themselves and not rely on cloud storage providers to protect their privacy. Encrinus decentralized documents management also allows users to restore their lost keys with the public&#39;s help.</p><p>The underlying document repository can be local using the user’s device storage or remote through cloud storage providers. Cloud storage partners only provide the infrastructure and have no control over the application layer. Partners provide APIs and them to Encrinus external connectors. Users can create multiple local or remote repositories of their choice. The golden rule is that the user always has complete control over their documents. They can store, share, sync, sign, and monetize their documents securely without leaving Encrinus wallet.</p><p><br></p><p>The Problem:</p><p>While cloud storage solves part of users’ struggles with documents managements, it creates many security challenges and doesn’t provide a user-friendly interface to store, share and sign documents securely. Even when cloud storage offers data encryption at rest and in transit, the end-users don’t have absolute control over their data. The complexity of secret keys management causes centralized cybersecurity solutions to come short and put data owners at risk. The digital transformation also comes with many challenges like the users’ identity and the cost of the electronic signatures.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution:</p><p>To isolate the cloud storage security issues, we built a decentralized documents access control on top of EOS. We selected the EOS blockchain because of its fine-grained permissions. EOS accounts are designed to efficiently identify users and grant them hierarchical permissions to run selective actions on the blockchain. EOS blockchain is a natural solution to efficiently streamline documents management, including tracking, routing, and electronic signatures. To put it all together, we designed a mobile-friendly application that allows individuals, governments, and businesses to store, share and sign documents securely. The application eliminates the risk of a mass data breach and provides privacy protection. The end-user or organization has complete control over its data. Users can also recover from losing their keys by creating one or more spare keys and using the public’s help to enable them. The application is also empowered by real-time monitoring and notifications. Encrinus also allows creators to monetize their intellectual properties by providing eCommerce solutions to sell their creations directly or through other DeFi and NFT blockchain platforms.</p>",

"description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8w8P2Oidm8&amp;ab_channel=SOVLabsLLC\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Click here to watch our presentation!</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p><ul><li>The EOS network is extremely difficult to onboard new users, with resource management being one of the greatest hurdles. Even for experienced users, managing resources remains tedious and cumbersome.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p><ul><li>We believe building an open-source solution to automatically manage CPU and NET would greatly increase the user experience of the EOS Network, help lessen barriers to entry, and increase network activity overall.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution - ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>Stake ECPU to receive automated CPU + Net Powerups Daily. Stake can be delegated to multiple users.</li><li>ECPU can be thought of as a CPU equity which represents ownership in a permanently locked pool of EOS, where returns are paid in the form of CPU and NET daily.</li><li>ECPU allows a one-time setup solution to CPU and NET. It will allow dApps to delegate CPU and NET to users for a daily allotment that requires zero effort for recipients, and minimal effort for dApps. The EOS pool will also be locked out of circulation, and will continue to grow with mining, REX appreciation, and excess voting rewards. ECPU will add deflationary pressure to the supply of EOS, which in turn will benefit all EOS holders.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Users</strong></p><ul><li>DApps managing resources on behalf of users</li><li>Users of DApps that do not pay for resources</li><li>Users onboarding friends and acquaintances </li><li>Power Users</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><ul><li>The smart-contract will hold a pool of EOS staked to REX with voting assigned to Reward Proxies.</li><li>Income from Reward Proxies will be utilized for automated CPU+NET powerups for all stakers of ECPU.</li><li>Token distribution will be credibly neutral, difficulty-adjusted mining, where contributing small amounts of EOS to the smart-contract pool will reward ECPU tokens. No developer allocation, pre-mine, or benefit to insiders whatsoever. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><ul><li>ENF Recognition Grant recipient SOV Labs LLC has experience creating dApps including SOVDEX(https://sovdex.io/ https://soveos.github.io/SOVDEX/), BTCMiner (www.btcminer.one ), SAFE (https://soveos.github.io/safefrontend/), and XSOV (https://soveos.github.io/xsov.app/).  </li><li>SOV Labs LLC also has previously utilized difficulty-adjusted mining to power automated payout and buyback systems (please see sovdexpaydiv and sovconverter contracts) and has created a token (SVX) with the ability to delegate its utility to other users.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Finances</strong></p><ul><li>Grant funds will be used to fund the initial smart-contract EOS pool (which will be locked out of circulation), as well as fund development of the open-source smart-contract, and open-source application front-end. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Success will be measured with the following deliverables:</strong></p><ul><li>Releasing working dApp with open-source smart-contract and open-source front-end code that fulfills design requirements (see slide).</li><li>Deploying a working initial instance of the open-source code.</li><li>Locking the Keys of the contract to 15/21 BP permission / locking the EOS Pool out of circulation.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Design Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Users staking ECPU must be able to receive daily pro-rata allotments of CPU + Net Resources without needing to sign any transactions. </li><li>Users must be able to delegate staked ECPU to multiple accounts from a single account.</li><li>ECPU must be a transferable token with credibly neutral mining system defined as: no team supply, no pre-mine, and difficulty adjusted by mining activity.</li><li>The EOS Pool must not be able to be withdrawn or be reduced, and must be locked out of circulation.</li><li>Waste Reduction method- example solution.. powerups will be delivered pro rata to stakers in according to total ecpu supply. Income not used is for powerups is added to REX. Inactive staked accounts reduced or eliminated daily powerup distribution until action pushed, etc..</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Timeline</strong></p><ul><li>11/2021 receive funding</li><li>3/2022 release open-source smart-contract code</li><li>4/2022 release open-source front-end code</li><li>5/2022 launch code with Pomelo funded EOS pool </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Current Alternate Solutions:</strong></p><ul><li>EOSPowerUp.io allows users to deposit EOS and receive daily powerups by subtracting from users balances daily and subtracting a fee upon transaction. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>ECPU Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li>ECPU does not require users to top up/continually pay, will take no fees for development team, and has a method to reduce waste. ECPU is a superior solution as it allows dApps to manage their ECPU delegated stake for their users, abstracting away CPU and NET costs completely for users. Unstaked ECPU is also liquid and transferable, allowing the owner to earn from providing liquidity, exchange for other tokens, and send to other accounts at their convenience.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why You Should Help Fund ECPU</strong></p><ul><li>ECPU will help create a better User Experience while adding flexibility and options for all EOS users. </li><li>ECPU will also put deflationary pressure on the EOS supply benefiting all EOS holders.</li><li>ECPU will have a fair distribution that will allow anyone to have liquid and transferable equity in a compounding pool of EOS.</li><li>ECPU contract and application code open-source and an asset to the community.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you for supporting EOS through Pomelo and reading our proposal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

"summary": "A platform to enable community building and discovery on Telos Blockchain. Many projects fail to market or reach the broader community as there&#39;s a lack of portals helping discover projects and communities building on the blockchain.",
"description": "<p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We have witnessed a lot of development on Telos, and many products try to venture, work hard, and fail because of a lack of community support. It is mostly the case with small teams with a lack of marketing bandwidth, trying to do crazy things but failing cause of no bandwidth or budget for marketing their development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Result </strong>- Poor feedback cycle, poor experience for builders, and loss of business from Telos to other Blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Good</strong> - We will provide the tools available to users free of cost, which includes listing your communities, quests, discord community management, staking and farming of NFTs and tokens (will be adding this to the smart contract), utility giveaway inspired by tropee.com, automating NFTs and FTs giveaways and analytics to help new project see how the quests are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>We won&#39;t be using the funds from Grant to fill our global reward pool. Though, the projects could pay for banners and sponsorships for better visibility which we shall be used to fill the reward pools until the project is standalone and have traction for the projects to see the value in Zila.</p><p><br></p><p>Our priority is to help projects succeed on Antelope blockchains and create a network effect of community building for the chains, reducing time in marketing and community reach out. It&#39;s a win-win for Telos and other blockchains combined.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Zila is building a platform where users could discover new communities listed on Telos (the communities could be new products, new services, influencers, or individual communities), help the community grow by following certain quests or tasks, and earn rewards in exchange. Any member who completes a certain task will be rewarded with Zila points (virtual for now) which get him into the local and global leader board.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits </strong></p><p><br></p><p>A directory for outside members to see how projects are doing on Telos. </p><p>Less time spend on marketing and community building. </p><p>Tools to reward loyal members. </p><p>Enabling the staking and farming of NFTs and FTs provides better economic values for all the stakeholders combined. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/1b818aba-8469-4255-864f-e202e328a5af.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community Trust </strong>- The communities listed will both be verified and non-verified (by Zila admin on Telos Blockchain) and could be upvoted or flagged by community members enabling more trust for other members to join. Only Zila NFT Pass holders will have the authority to upvote/flag communities which reduces spamming and bot account networks.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/e9d8dc0f-a1c0-4f83-bded-31363c1b50e6.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rewards and Utilities</strong> - Community Owners will be able to reward the community members with NFTs, Tokens, and whitelisting, and also have them claim Utilities like Merchandise (to segment an audience holding a certain number of tokens or NFTs in their account), Premium Event Links, Promo Codes, Content, Files, vIRLs and much more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bots</strong> - The platform will be connected with the Discord Community of projects with the help of the Zila bot, which could read the roles of members on Discord, and their activity and build the task for members with segmented roles, the bot could also award the members with better roles as they complete different quests.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow </strong>- Users will be able to follow other users and get notified when certain users complete a certain task. Also, a telegram bot will help them notifying with new communities getting listed on Telos Blockchain. So they could join their community, help them with feedback and claim rewards both locally (given by the community) and globally (given by Zila).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward Pools</strong> - We are working on adding Reward pools in which both new and existing products could transfer rewards in exchange for banners and other perks. When a user completes a certain number of quests across all the communities gets some reward from the pool. The pools incentivize the members to keep on exploring new communities and help bring new audiences for all the new projects. It&#39;s a win for the entire Telos community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discussion</strong> - Members will also have a place to get involved in threaded discussions much like Reddit within the Zila community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shops</strong> - Communities will be able to set up their own NFT Shop for selling NFTs directly to users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Smart Contract </strong>- community names, upvotes, and flags are pushed on Blockchain. Users are also verified on Blockchain. We are working on adding pools and milestones.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Task/Quest include </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Telegram(Join community)</p><p>Discord (Join Server)</p><p>Twitch (Subscribe/Follow)</p><p>Daily Streak (Points for showing up on the community daily)</p><p>Questionnaire (feedback/market research)</p><p>Quizzes</p><p>Upload images/links</p><p>Share docs</p><p>Share links</p><p>Invite other members</p><p>Share leads</p><p>Share Ideas</p><p>and much much more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where are we now? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>We have released the Beta version of the platform on WAX Blockchain, idea is to make it a hub for the entire Antelope space to come together and help push products building on top. We have a great community and builders who keep on working on creative projects but we lack coordination and marketing support.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Team Behind the Project</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We are team Ledgerwise.io, we were among the very few BP nodes who were part of EOS genesis days as EOSMetal.</p>",

"description": "<p>Dear community</p><p><br></p><p>My name is Lukas Mantinger, I am an active Eden member since the beginning and I&#39;m excited to present to you our <em>english</em> to <em>german</em> translation project of Daniel Larimers book <em>More Equal Animals - The subtile Art of True Democracy.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Back in summer 2021 I came up with the idea to translate Dan&#39;s book into my native language. My aim was to help spread Dan&#39;s ideas in the german speaking community to make it more accessible for people who are not proficient in English. Soon I realized though, that my English was too weak to do the job, so I asked my friend <em>@marconamaste</em> for help. We agreed on 5,000 Euro worth of EOS for the translation. So together with small EOS translation group, including telegramusers @<em>orasapte</em> and @<em>RubixLoop</em> from <a href=\"http://EOSsupport.io\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>EOSsupport.io</em></a> we went for it.</p><p><br></p><p>To mitigate risks of a highly volatile market on both sites <em>@marconamaste</em> and I agreed to an energy compensation of 5 installments (1,000 Euro each) at the end of every month with the EOS price on the very last day of the according month. So while in the beginning of this project EOS was around $6, during the 5 months it changed (you know where it went) and finally a total 1,415 EOS was transferred to my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>During our collaboration I could motivate my friend to take a look at the Eden and its ecosystem. I was glad to see him join after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I was ready to pay the whole amount out of my own pocket. I wanted to get this project moving - I was convinced of it, and I had the capabilities to finance it. Do not complain - simply do it! Right? But after some time I thought: aren&#39;t we actually creating a valuable public good from which the whole community benefits? A large group might be interested in helping getting these promising projects financed. I also spoke about it on our first Eden elections in october last year and got some funding assured (which is mentioned at the beginning of the book).</p><p><br></p><p>In this spirit I created this grant, and with the idea to invest the eventually surplus (after reaching 1,415 EOS) in the production of a high quality audiobook of this german version of <em>More Equal Animals, </em>again in collaboration with <em>@marconamaste </em>and a printversion which @<em>orasapte (</em>pomelouser horst4) runs his own grant for. Further we will use the capital to reach a bigger audience.</p><p><br></p><p>There&#39;s over a 100 million native German speakers worldwide, all speakers included, about 185 million people - there is a lot of potential. This project will add great value to EOS and help a lot of people open their eyes to a true realistic and alternative way of <em>doing</em> politics and society.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost any human organization faces power centralization over time. Daniel shows in this book ways to mitigate those effects and explains how to make governance more fair and efficient. Daniel Larimer has experience in building communities since almost 10 years, in which he developed and distributed software for several decentralized systems. Many of these experiences, including the essence of the governance issues that the EOS community has been facing since launch of mainnet and possible solutions to them, are packed into this small book. So it is also a must read for everyone looking for a broader approach to <em>blockchainsdecentralized decision-making</em> and <em>general</em> government structures - besides <em>bare</em> capital gains.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3kx1KVFXzYKdjOe4o5a0xqGz0quWE8I/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">The german version of <em>More Equal Animals </em>&#34;<em>Gleichere Tiere, die subtile Kunst echter Demokratie&#34; </em>can be downloaded here for private use and is completely free. Spread the word!</a></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your support!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Liebe Gemeinschaft,</p><p><br></p><p>Mein Name ist Lukas Mantinger und aktives Eden-Mitglied von Anfang an. Ich freue mich euch unser Englisch-Deutsch-Übersetzungsprojekt von Daniel Larimers Buch More Equal Animals - The subtile Art of True Democracy vorzustellen.</p><p><br></p><p>Im Sommer 2021 kam mir die Idee, Dans Buch in meine Muttersprache zu übersetzen. Mein Ziel war es, dabei zu helfen, Dans Ideen im deutschsprachigen Sprachraum zu verbreiten und sie für Menschen ohne Englischkenntnisse zugänglicher zu machen. Bald merkte ich jedoch, dass mein Englisch für eine halbwegs hochwertige Übersetzung nicht ausreichte, also bat ich meinen Freund @marconamaste um Hilfe. Wir haben uns für die Übersetzung auf EOS im Wert von 5.000 Euro geeinigt. Zusammen mit einer kleinen EOS-Übersetzungsgruppe, darunter Telegramnutzer @orasapte und @RubixLoop von <a href=\"http://EOSsupport.io\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>EOSsupport.io</em></a>, sind wir an die Sache rangegangen.</p><p><br></p><p>Um das Risiko des volatilen Marktes auf beiden Seiten zu minimieren, haben @marconamaste und ich abgemacht, die Vergütung in 5 Raten (je 1.000 Euro) am Ende jedes Monats mit dem EOS-Preis am letzten Tag des jeweiligen Monats zu entrichten. Während der EOS-Preis zu Beginn dieses Projekts bei etwa 6 US-Dollar lag, änderte er sich während der 5 Monate nicht unerheblich (ihr wisst, wohin es ging) und schließlich wurden meinem Freund insgesamt 1.415 EOS überwiesen.</p><p><br></p><p>Während unserer Zusammenarbeit konnte ich ihn dazu motivieren, einen Blick auf Eden und sein Ökosystem zu werfen. Ich war froh, ihn nach einiger Zeit beitreten zu sehen.</p><p><br></p><p>Zunächst war ich bereit, den gesamten Betrag aus eigener Tasche zu bezahlen. Ich wollte dieses Projekt auf den Weg bringen – ich war davon überzeugt, und ich hatte die Möglichkeiten, es zu finanzieren. Nicht meckern - einfach mal machen! Nicht? Aber nach einiger Zeit dachte ich: Schaffen wir nicht eigentlich ein wertvolles öffentliches Gut, von dem die ganze Gemeinschaft profitiert? Eine größere Gruppe könnte daran interessiert sein, bei der Finanzierung dieser vielversprechenden Projekte zu helfen. Auch habe ich das Thema bei unseren ersten Eden-Wahlen im Oktober letzten Jahres angesprochen und mir wurde finanzielle Unterstützung zugesprochen, was am Anfang des Buches auch erwähnt wird.</p><p><br></p><p>In diesem Sinne habe ich dieses Pomelo-Stipendium geschaffen, und mit der Idee, den eventuellen Überschuss (nach Erreichen von 1.415 EOS) in die Produktion eines hochwertigen Hörbuchs dieser deutschen Version von More Equal Animals zu investieren, wiederum in Zusammenarbeit mit @marconamaste und eventuell in eine Druckversion des Buches, für die @<em>orasapte </em>(pomelonutzer horst4) sein eigenes Pomelo-Stipendium betreibt. Außerdem werden wir das Kapital nutzen, um ein größeres Publikum zu erreichen.</p><p><br></p><p>Weltweit gibt es über 100 Millionen deutsche Muttersprachler, alle Sprecher eingeschlossen, etwa 185 Millionen Menschen – das Potential ist groß. Dieses Projekt wird EOS einen großen Mehrwert bringen und vielen Menschen helfen, ihre Augen für eine wirklich realistische und alternative Art und Weise zu öffnen, Politik und Gesellschaft zu organisieren.</p><p><br></p><p>Fast jede menschliche Organisation sieht sich im Laufe der Zeit einer Machtzentralisierung ausgesetzt. Daniel zeigt in diesem Buch Wege auf, diese Auswirkungen abzumildern, und erklärt, wie man Führungsstrukturen fairer und effizienter gestalten kann. Daniel Larimer hat seit fast 10 Jahren Erfahrung im Aufbau von organisierten Gemeinschaften für deren dezentrale Organisation er Software Systeme entwickelt hat. Viele dieser Erfahrungen, darunter die Essenz der Governance-Probleme, die die EOS-Community seit dem Start des Mainnets diskutiert und mögliche Lösungen dafür, sind in diesem kleinen Werk verpackt. Es ist auch eine Pflichtlektüre für alle, die neben den bloßen Kapitalgewinnen einen breiteren Ansatz für Blockchains, dezentrale Entscheidungsfindung und allgemeine Regierungsstrukturen suchen.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3kx1KVFXzYKdjOe4o5a0xqGz0quWE8I/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">Die deutsche Version von More Equal Animals &#34;Gleichere Tiere, die subtile Kunst echter Demokratie&#34; kann hier für den privaten Gebrauch heruntergeladen werden und ist völlig kostenlos.

"description": "<p>When we talk about video games, we often refer to console or PC games, where the user follows a plot, completes the various objectives and reaches the end of the same, unlocking almost all the upgrades and seeing the end of the game/plot .</p><p><br></p><p>However, few imagine that video games can also be created on blockchain and that they also allow you to earn something, whether crypto or NFT, contributing to the player&#39;s gaming experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to NFTs, this becomes even more interesting as players actually own an asset of their own with which to interact in the game but also exploit it to obtain advantages such as renting out their character.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A simple but complex game</strong></p><p><br></p><p>To be able to create a video game on blockchain, it is not enough to have just any blockchain available, but a solid and very fast structure is required, as the various transactions must be acceptable in terms of speed and make the gaming experience pleasant.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only must the blockchain be solid and fast, but also practical and economical, because if it requires too many functions from the player to just be able to play, or it becomes expensive to carry out individual transactions, then the video game, no matter how well built, fails to attract users.</p><p>And here, as the market has taught, blockchain video games have taken root above all on the various EVMs, which have been able to exploit their performance characteristics, without requiring users to change wallets or install anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>This game was created right on the EOS EVM, thus being able to unite EOS users as they have the EOS crypto but do not have interesting applications or games of various kinds, and also intercept all the other users already accustomed to the EVMs and therefore, in one click, see and test the power of that EVM.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gaming as user onboarding</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to what has been said, and to the fact that, numerically speaking, there are more video gamers than crypto users, it is natural that a part of the users who could land in the blockchain sector are video gamers.</p><p><br></p><p>However, they can be intercepted by speaking their own language which is, in fact, video games, which in this case are not simple video games but a bridge between fun and knowledge of the crypto world as a blockchain game requires a minimum of in-depth analysis technology that is used precisely to interact with the video game.</p><p><br></p><p>So by intercepting a user base that does not decrease, but rather increases from year to year, providing an interesting product comparable to a medium level game and with functions that are impossible in traditional video games, here is the ecosystem on which that video game is based , benefits enormously.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to court gamers</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Obviously it is not by casual advertising to players, as they would have little understanding of the technical aspect of the underlying blockchain, instead we need to communicate to them the advantages that blockchain video games offer compared to traditional video games.</p><p>First of all there is the economic aspect as a blockchain video game does not require dedicated hardware such as a console or a powerful PC with the latest GPU model, costs which basically vary between €300 and €2000 , only for the hardware part, not to mention the fact that the video game has a separate cost between €20 and €70.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, most blockchain video games are free or have an entry cost, such as the purchase of NFTs to play, which is truly negligible, between €0.1 and €10, effectively placing them among the products in terms of technology ratio used/price among the lowest on the market.</p><p>In fact, the average gamer, by playing a blockchain video game, effectively saves 100% on the cost of the hardware while on the cost of the single video game between 85% and 99%, effectively saving between €310 and €2060.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention other advantages associated with blockchain video games such as:</p><p><br></p><p>- Immutable and continuous saving</p><p>- Possession of the purchased assets</p><p>- Monetization of purchased assets</p><p>- Security against cheaters and crackers</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The new frontiers of gaming</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Aware of the opportunity that the blockchain gaming sector offers, the Hoken Tech team, already known for its developments in the gaming sector on the EOS blockchain, has begun a process of creating some solutions, including blockchain video games, taking advantage of the EOS EVM.</p><p><br></p><p>In this case the video game, already in the testing phase here (https://bucolic-maamoul-e53599.netlify.app/), uses NFTs in the format of a playable hero, who will fight against the boss, trying to make as many as much damage as possible, and where once the hero is exhausted, the player will be able to stake his NFT and have the hero&#39;s life points recovered, where every minute spent staking the NFT is 1 life point gained (and all this without anyone being able to force the condition or change the clock of their device to speed up the process).</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/b8b9f504-42e7-4a25-acca-ddf0585be571.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><p>Not only is the player exploiting a character in a dynamic way and linked in a real way to the time spent recovering life points, but also the video game allows gamers to rent and rent other players&#39; heroes, in this way the player can earn real cryptocurrencies, and not the fictitious tokens we find in traditional games.</p><p><br></p><p><img

convenient as the NFT to play and which will be owned by the user, costs just 0.10 EOS while the combat transaction is just 0.006 EOS, demonstrating how Indeed, blockchain video games are cheap compared to their traditional counterparts.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/e3fc7e2b-2a01-49c6-bc6a-9906588a9f43.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support

"summary": "Empowering human-centric DAOs",
"description": "<p>Albedo is an initiative to research and develop healthy communication methods between human-centric<a href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>decentralized autonomous organizations</em> (DAOs) and traditional blockchains. This includes researching and developing protocols and tools for human-centric DAOs to become truly autonomous and fully interoperable with blockchains.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>The problem</strong></h1><p>Communities that want to create a DAO, typically face a couple of key issues.</p><p><br></p><h2>They need blockchain accounts and to pay fees for transactions</h2><p>If we want decentralized governance mechanisms to scale, we have to make them user-friendly enough for people who don&#39;t know what a blockchain is. Having to create a blockchain account and invest (even if a small amount) is simply too big of a hurdle for them to jump through.</p><p><br></p><h2>They need to choose what blockchain to build on</h2><p>These people might not be technical and might not be coming from the crypto world, but the implications of choosing one or the other underlying blockchain for a DAO might have a lot of technical implications, which further lead to security and governance implications for the future of a DAO. Also, the usability of a blockchain depends on some factors which are impossible to predict beforehand (like congestion issues, and fees).</p><p><br></p><p>The key issue here is that migrating an active DAO from one chain to another is not trivial and might lead to a fork of a DAO (so you cannot just use what works now and just switch whenever it stops working)<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grant/edit/albedo#sdfootnote3sym\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Furthermore, the security of a DAO governance mechanism starts depending on the security of a governance mechanism of a particular blockchain, which complicates this choice even more. In other words, DAO creators, besides having to decide on details of their governance mechanism have to additionally be blockchain experts.</p><p><br></p><p>I came to realize that the causes for this issue are quite fundamental. What we call a &#34;DAO&#34;, typically depends on a consensus process of a blockchain. As a result, a typical &#34;DAO&#34; does not truly own its consensus process and is therefore not truly autonomous<sup><u>2</u></sup>.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Solution: Part 1</strong></h1><p>How can a DAO become truly autonomous? There’s an obvious answer - it can run its own totally independent consensus process. It could run its own blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, running a blockchain is typically expensive and requires infrastructure. This would make this path unsuitable for small communities.</p><p><br></p><p>But the only reason why typical blockchains require infrastructure and are so expensive to run is that they try to execute large amounts of transactions coming from all over the world as fast as possible with near 100% availability. But not everything requires such performance.</p><p><br></p><p>A human-centered DAO like <a href=\"https://fractally.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fractally</a> or <a href=\"https://www.edenelections.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eden</a> is ruled by human consensus. The thing about human consensus is that it is quite rare and slow. You need people gathering together and discussing and actively voting to achieve human consensus. This consensus nevertheless is the root of all trust in human-centered DAO frameworks like the one described in the <a href=\"https://fractally.com/whitepaper/fractally_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fractally whitepaper</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>So the idea is to have a blockchain that would be run at the speed of human consensus (blocks would be produced only when an organization of people signals consensus). This would make it terribly slow compared to typical blockchains, but this slowness is also its strength:</p><ul><li>Such slow blockchains can be trivially run and validated by end-user computers instead of them relying on light client implementations and large validator nodes;</li><li>These blockchains can also be fully validated by normal (fast) blockchain-based smart contract platforms (Ethereum, EOS, etc);</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The second point also means that smart contract platforms can recreate the full state of a DAO, from its blocks. This means that a DAO can have the security of a blockchain as slow as human consensus and still deploy applications that require speed (like cryptocurrencies)! Additionally, this DAO could run its applications on multiple blockchains at the same time. <strong>So no need to couple your DAO to any single blockchain, anymore!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This also solves the onboarding issue related to blockchain accounts and fees. These slow blockchains will have their own accounts, which can be automatically created by the user&#39;s browser. Fees are also a non-issue because blocks will only be created when people gather to reach consensus and they will only include data that people reach consensus on. If a DAO will want to integrate with existing chains there will only have to be at least 1 person who pushes blocks of a DAO to those chains (everyone else won&#39;t even have to have accounts of these chains).</p><p><br></p><p>I&#39;m calling a protocol for these slow blockchains - Firmament. You can read more about the idea <a href=\"https://peakd.com/fractally/@sim31/fractal-blockchains\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (it&#39;s called &#34;fractal blockchains&#34; in that article).</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Solution: Part 2</strong></h1><p>Another part of Albedo project is getting traditional on-chain governance and human-centric DAOs to interact so that they can help each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Solution to this part is in research stage. A couple of work-in-progress designs can be found in these posts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://peakd.com/blockchain/@sim31/albedo-idea-in-a-nutshell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Albedo idea in a nutshell</a></li><li><a href=\"https://peakd.com/dao/@sim31/fungibility-out-of-non-fungible-tokens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fungibility out of non-fungible tokens</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h1><strong>Who can benefit from this?</strong></h1><p>Firmament will be useful for anyone who wants to create a decentralized human organization but does not know anything about blockchains. It’s the first step towards a seamless DAO creation where the user does not even have to have a blockchain account. DAO will not even have to interact with blockchains if they don’t need to (thus saving on fees). In general, it will enable running DAOs more cheaply (in theory consensus meetings by fractal participants could be run in a totally p2p way, without requiring any infrastructure at all).</p><p><br></p><p>However, even if DAO starts out without using any normal blockchain, it can deploy their DAO to any EVM-enabled chain. Moreover, they will have the same address reserved on all EVM chains (made possible by <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470\" rel=\"nofollow\">pattern described here</a>). Compared to typical on-chain DAOs, this solution will enable an unprecedented level of security (see <a href=\"https://peakd.com/fractally/@sim31/fractal-blockchains\" rel=\"nofollow\">fractal blockchains post</a> for how).</p><p><br></p><p>All products of this grant (software and documentation) are open-sourced.</p><p><br></p><h2>EOS EVM</h2><p>The above is the long-term high-level vision. In the short-term to deploy a DAO to any EVM enabled chain and make full use of it, you&#39;ll first need some supporting tools / software:</p><ul><li>Library smart contracts to be deployed on the target EVM chain;</li><li>Frontend applications that make DAOs interaction with target EVM chain easy for people;</li><li>Other supporting smart contracts to help interaction between firmament smart contracts and other smart contracts in the ecosystem of a target EVM chain;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The EVM chain that has all of these things prepared, will obviously attract more firmament-based DAOs. The purpose of this grant is to implement this on EOS EVM.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Where can I learn more?</strong></h1><p>You can find more resources on Albedo <a href=\"https://edencreators.com/albedo\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (helpfully curated by <a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/edencreators\" rel=\"nofollow\">edencreators</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>Also, if you have any questions or want to help, please join our <a href=\"https://t.me/chain_albedo\" rel=\"nofollow\">telegram group</a>.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Author of the grant</strong></h1><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tadasvait/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Developer</a> with experience developing on EOS and researching blockchain technologies.

Our first idea was that Oldtimer (OLD) Token is a utility token. OLD exists in the forms of ERC-20 Token and Nuls Token. In these forms, OLD is based on the Ethereum Blockchain MainNet and Nuls network.</p><p><br></p><p>2019. Oldtimer (OLD) token was created on Ethereum Blockchain MainNet (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6e514de4c2675feeb51d759977b4222dc65556af#code\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://etherscan.io/address/0x6e514de4c2675feeb51d759977b4222dc65556af#code</a>). That was a bad moment for startups because a lot of scams ICO projects appeared in 2017. &amp; 2018. Investors were scared to invest in new projects and new ideas. We made development &amp; research without investment from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>2020. The blockchain market was in much better shape but a new problem appear. The huge price of ETH (Ethereum) made the costs of transactions incredibly high. That was a signal to us that we must look for an alternative.</p><p><br></p><p>2021. Our hard work and unique idea were recognized by the Nuls community and they called us to be a part of the Nuls SCO programs (<a href=\"https://pocm.nuls.io/pocm/Projects/ProjectsList\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pocm.nuls.io/pocm/Projects/ProjectsList</a>). For us was a good step because we created an NRC-20 token with our Brand name on Nuls Blockchain Network(<a href=\"https://nulscan.io/token/info?contractAddress=NULSd6HgmWcJ6UHi94zCrY3DqcDemrEXADwTY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://nulscan.io/token/info?contractAddress=NULSd6HgmWcJ6UHi94zCrY3DqcDemrEXADwTY</a>).</p><p>A bridge between OLD(ERC-20) and OLD(NRC-20) was created via Nerve Network (NerveDEX.com). The transaction is cheap and fast on Nuls, but another problem is that the Nuls blockchain network is not so popular in the crypto community and some important development parts are missing, such as creating DAO which is a very important part of any project.</p><pre>\n</pre>",

"description": "<p>Hello Pomelo, EOS and Telos Community,</p><p><br></p><p>It&#39;s NEO here.</p><p><br></p><p>I was involved in to Telos Blockchain since November 2021 when I became a part of Telos Eagles Team, then program have been re-organized and I am now a part of the Telos Ambassadors Team. In July 2022 I have create my Telos brand called &#34;NEO Talks Telos&#34; with YouTube Channel. Since that I have created a lot of video tutorials, shorts, news, announcements, podcasts (spotify, itunes, google), twitter spaces, livestreams etc</p><p><br></p><p>YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@neotalkstelos </p><p><br></p><p>or just type in &#34;NEO Talks Telos&#34; in to Google or YouTube Search and it will arrive :)</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to continue with that and provide more content but I also need some support to make this happen. </p><p><br></p><p>I want to still share my knowledge within Telos tutorials, news, interviews and more. My aim is to do 2-3 videos/shorts per week plus Twitter Spaces and/or Livestreams.</p><p><br></p><p>First thing I need is to upgrade my gear, the most important is laptop because I use 7 years old one and it starts to crash and going very slow. I want to invest in to powerful one probably that &#34;gaming&#34; models to render video/audio faster and have it for another few years. I would like to buy External Monitor to do multitasking, Podcast microphone to improve audio quality, some new gaming chair to work more comfortable, glasses with bluelight filter.</p><p><br></p><p>To upgrade my gear I would need $2000 (I will also be transparent and show what I bought through video).</p><p><br></p><p>Another part is my daily activities to just focus on creating content for Telos. My bills, life expenses, my work and my time. For that I would need $2000/month.</p><p><br></p><p>So in total is $2000 + $2000 = $4000 for a first month to upgrade my gear, provide content and proof that it is worth it to support me for longer.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that Pomelo is not monthy based and happens every few months so basically It will be awesome to get any support possible to keep channel alive :)</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your time.</p><p>Stay Safe.</p><p>Peace.</p><p><br></p><p>/NEO</p>",

"description": "<p>In the era of cloud storage, the public’s privacy is at risk. Most storage providers encrypt data at rest, but who has the keys? For users who want to take control of their data, Encrinus provides a free application that allows them to encrypt data themselves and not rely on cloud storage providers to protect their privacy. Encrinus decentralized documents management also allows users to restore their lost keys with the public&#39;s help.</p><p>The underlying document repository can be local using the user’s device storage or remote through cloud storage providers. Cloud storage partners only provide the infrastructure and have no control over the application layer. Partners provide APIs and them to Encrinus external connectors. Users can create multiple local or remote repositories of their choice. The golden rule is that the user always has complete control over their documents. They can store, share, sync, sign, and monetize their documents securely without leaving Encrinus wallet.</p><p><br></p><p>The Problem:</p><p>While cloud storage solves part of users’ struggles with documents managements, it creates many security challenges and doesn’t provide a user-friendly interface to store, share and sign documents securely. Even when cloud storage offers data encryption at rest and in transit, the end-users don’t have absolute control over their data. The complexity of secret keys management causes centralized cybersecurity solutions to come short and put data owners at risk. The digital transformation also comes with many challenges like the users’ identity and the cost of the electronic signatures.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution:</p><p>To isolate the cloud storage security issues, we built a decentralized documents access control on top of EOS. We selected the EOS blockchain because of its fine-grained permissions. EOS accounts are designed to efficiently identify users and grant them hierarchical permissions to run selective actions on the blockchain. EOS blockchain is a natural solution to efficiently streamline documents management, including tracking, routing, and electronic signatures. To put it all together, we designed a mobile-friendly application that allows individuals, governments, and businesses to store, share and sign documents securely. The application eliminates the risk of a mass data breach and provides privacy protection. The end-user or organization has complete control over its data. Users can also recover from losing their keys by creating one or more spare keys and using the public’s help to enable them. The application is also empowered by real-time monitoring and notifications. Encrinus also allows creators to monetize their intellectual properties by providing eCommerce solutions to sell their creations directly or through other DeFi and NFT blockchain platforms.</p>",

"description": "<p>Since its launch in 1989, the handheld has won the hearts of millions of gamers worldwide and revolutionized the portable gaming market, introducing us to unforgettable characters and engaging adventures. Even today, the handheld  continues to hold a special place in many gamers&#39; hearts, evoking waves of nostalgia and fond memories.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, imagine combining the timeless appeal of handheld with the cutting-edge technology of blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>That&#39;s exactly what Hoken Tech has achieved with <a href=\"https://hokentech.itch.io/leap-to-nft\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Leap to NFT</u></a>.</p><p><br></p><p>By integrating blockchain technology into the handheld experience, Hoken Tech has created the first NFT video game that combines the retro charm of handheld fgaming with the unique capabilities and potential of blockchain technology.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/bc179063-434d-4d5c-a447-880ce3c16f3e.png\"></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Harnessing the Power of NFTs in Leap to NFT</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>So, what exactly are these NFTs that are causing a buzz in the gaming industry? NFTs, also known as non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or content. In Leap to NFT, these tokens open up a whole new world of possibilities for gamers.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagine owning exclusive in-game assets that can&#39;t be replicated or counterfeited. In Leap to NFT, you can collect, trade, and sell NFTs, once the video game is completed, the possibilities are endless. What makes NFTs even more exciting is the possibility for gamers to monetize their NFTs. With the EOS blockchain infrastructure, gamers can sell or trade their NFTs online, creating an entirely new economy outside the game.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>The Gaming Experience of Leap to NFT</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>As you immerse yourself in the world of <a href=\"https://hokentech.itch.io/leap-to-nft\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Leap to NFT</u></a>, prepare to be transported into a vibrant and visually stunning world. The gameplay mechanics of Leap to NFT have been carefully designed to capture handheld enthusiasts and ignite the spirit of adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>Face diverse obstacles, defeat formidable opponents, and explore immersive worlds, all with the unmistakable nostalgia of handheld . But what sets Leap to NFT apart is the integration of NFTs into the game itself, with these unique digital assets unlocking equally unique content only the holders will discover.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>The Implications and Benefits of Leap to NFT for handheld</strong> <strong>Enthusiasts</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://hokentech.itch.io/leap-to-nft\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Leap to NFT</u></a> has far-reaching implications not only for handheld enthusiasts but also for the entire gaming community. The introduction of NFTs into gaming creates a new opportunity for gamers to truly own and trade their virtual properties, blurring the line between virtual and physical ownership.</p><p><br></p><p>For handheld enthusiasts, <a href=\"https://hokentech.itch.io/leap-to-nft\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Leap to NFT</u></a> offers an exciting opportunity to relive precious gaming moments from their past while exploring the possibilities of the future. Plus, with the ability to monetize their skills and collections, gamers can transform their passion into a potential income source.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Gaming as user onboarding</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Thanks to what has been said, and to the fact that, numerically speaking, there are more video gamers than crypto users, it is natural that a part of the users who could land in the blockchain sector are video gamers.</p><p><br></p><p>However, they can be intercepted by speaking their own language which is, in fact, video games, which in this case are not simple video games but a bridge between fun and knowledge of the crypto world as a blockchain game requires a minimum of in-depth analysis technology that is used precisely to interact with the video game.</p><p><br></p><p>So by intercepting a user base that does not decrease, but rather increases from year to year, providing an interesting product comparable to a medium level game and with functions that are impossible in traditional video games, here is the ecosystem on which that video game is based , benefits enormously.</p><p><br></p><p>Since launch, this video game alone has had over 180 views and a hundred players, with numbers growing from time to time:</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/512ba0f7-d570-40bc-9383-0f4b3d072dc3.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Support progress</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Hoken Tech invests a lot of time and resources in progress and punctually shows its progress despite the limited funds available, but thanks to your support this project will continue, creating other blockchain video games, taking advantage of the code developed and which works with the EOS blockchain.</p>",

"description": "<p>Hello everyone! I am thrilled to announce my latest project, the Python Smart Contracts Development Kit. After months of hard work, I am excited to show this project to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The Python Smart Contracts Development Kit is based on the Codon project, a high-performance, zero-overhead, extensible Python compiler that uses LLVM. Codon project is a static Python language compiler that has impressive performance. Python Smart Contracts Development Kit is essentially a port of the Codon project. The most challenging part was making Codon work on the WebAssembly platform and build the python smart contracts framework, but after a few months of hard development, it appears to be working well now. Compared to my previous Python Smart Contracts project that ran Python bytecode in a virtual machine, this project compiles Python code directly into WebAssembly binary code, enabling Python code to run with a performance that can be compared to that of C/C++.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out the example contracts on our GitHub page:</p><p><br></p><p>https://github.com/uuosio/python-smart-contracts-examples</p><p><br></p><p>This project is currently under active development, and I plan to make the code open source once it&#39;s ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Here are some Q&amp;A:</p><p><br></p><p>Q: Is the Python Smart Contract fast enough?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Yes, it is supposed to be as fast as C++ since it compiles to native code using LLVM.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: What about the compiled smart contract size?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Currently, it is a little larger than a C++ smart contract that has the same functionality, but there is still plenty of room for optimization.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: What license has Python Smart Contracts Development Kit chosen?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Since the Codon project uses the Business Source License, you need to obtain a license from Codon to use the Python Smart Contracts Development Kit in production. However, after communicating with the developer of codon project, they told us &#34;Their main goal with the BSL was to make sure big companies wouldn’t use Codon without at least giving something back to support its development.&#34; and &#34;they are exploring that right now and are thinking about making the core completely open source&#34;.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>After all, any grants received during this season will be donated to the Codon team as a token of appreciation for their commendable efforts.</p>",

There was a need for alternative dispute resolution aligned with building trust and improving well-being in multiple communities, and that is why we are <a href=\"https://gravitydao.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>launching our page,</strong></a> where you can request support, both from an individual or organization perspective, learn and get trained in conflict management skills, and engage to participate in other activities like researches, consultations or safe spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>We believe that this courses will have an impact on multiple communities, since the collective competence to manage conflicts in a community is reinforced through the development of the individual capacities of its members. We will be launching our first <strong>free 100% online course on march - april of 2023</strong>, <strong>and with funding from grants like this, we want to continue expanding our educational offering with additional courses</strong> that can dive deeper into what we consider a life long learning of being able to manage conflict and experience wellbeing in our lives and works.</p>",

"description": "<h1><strong>First Free &amp; Arabic Course in Fractal Governance based on More Equal Animals Book &amp; EdenOS Solution</strong></h1><p><br></p><h2><strong>Pitching </strong></h2><p><br></p><p>I am proposing to extend my work after the successful translation of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@fadialshalabi/review-of-the-arabic-translation-of-more-equal-animals-the-subtle-art-of-true-democracy-86250357a33e\" rel=\"nofollow\">More Equal Animals Book into Arabic</a>, and move it forward into the first free Arabic Course.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will be free open source under the creative commons license and will move the book from elite reading to a large scale.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Most projects involving teamwork as well as most ideas of organizing local communities fail when attempts are made to build a successful governance model. In most cases, the matter turns directly to building alliances inside the group in one way or another and giving a particular lobby all the power regarding decision-making, which will then take the group in the direction it wants.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in the game of free democratic elections, influencers collect votes from those who are not interested in the election process. By doing so, they can achieve a simple majority of 51%, which allows them to be declared legitimate representatives of society.</p><p><br></p><p>In his book titled &#34; <a href=\"https://falkvinge.net/files/2013/04/Swarmwise-2013-by-Rick-Falkvinge-v1.1-2013Sep01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swarmwise</a>: The Tactical Manual to Changing the World,” <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Falkvinge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Falkvinge</a> talks about the Heisenberg metrics phenomenon and its impact on various organizations. The idea is summarized by the fact that individuals intend to act dishonestly in order to support their win. A typical example of Heisenberg metrics in practice is what happened with the site mp3.com. This site was a pioneer in the music cloud business in 2011 when they offered what is called a pay-for-play service. This is a service in which an artist would get a piece of the site’s revenue, which was distributed amongst all of the artists on mp3.com in accordance with how much their songs were played on the site. The result was that everybody wanted to financially support their favorite artists. To do so, they set up all the computers they could access to play music from said artist on the site, but with the volume turned off as to not disturb anybody. Some people coded bots that would repeatedly stream an artist’s music to boost artificial numbers, which of course translated into money. Heisenberg metrics unfortunately also happen at the political level, and when people rig this, their candidate has to win.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time candidates focus on the process of winning elections for team or group governance, and the goal of winning is quite different from actually representing the real team. This is especially true with the current political games such as political advocacy campaigns, defamation of politicians, politics of focusing on identity and excluding others, the manipulation of votes and of the delimitation of electoral districts, and television debates. With all this in mind, one cannot be sure that this leads to fair representation for all in governance.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>The course</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>The course will contain video lectures and support material in Arabic explaining the book, and EdenOS work in fractal democratic governance process for blockchain-powered communities.</p><p><br></p><p>The course will cover of course basics of blockchain and EOSIO</p><p><br></p><p>The course will be a free and public good and the first-ever idea in Arabic. </p><p><br></p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://violet.garden/post/My-introduction-of-The-Arabic-Translation-of-More-Equal-Animals-Book-5253\" rel=\"nofollow\">My introduction of The Arabic Translation of More Equal Animals Book</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fadialshalabi/review-of-the-arabic-translation-of-more-equal-animals-the-subtle-art-of-true-democracy-86250357a33e\" rel=\"nofollow\">Review of the Arabic translation of “More Equal Animals: the Subtle Art of True Democracy”</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://payhip.com/b/iDOGr\" rel=\"nofollow\">More Equal Animals Arabic translation</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

In light of this, our team has invested a significant amount of time and effort into researching and developing a cross-chain bridge solution, which has ultimately led to the successful creation of the obridge project.

This is not just the growth of a project but the growth of every EOS enthusiast, developer, and supporter.</p><p><br></p><h1>Future Development</h1><p>The future development of the cross-chain bridge project will include ongoing optimization and enhancements to meet the growing demand for cross-chain capabilities. The project plans to support more blockchain networks in the future, add multi-signature support for bridge contract permissions, implement a multi-node voting mechanism, and provide more flexible fee configurations. If the project can secure sufficient funding support, we will seek contract audits and strive to launch on the mainnet as soon as possible to achieve broader ecosystem interoperability.</p><p><br></p><h1>Open Source Plan</h1><p>Once the project development is complete, audited, and launched on the mainnet, all contracts and voting nodes will be open-sourced for community review.</p><p><br></p><h1>Use of Funds</h1><p>- Initial funds will primarily be used for the research and development of the bridge project.</p><p>- Subsequent funds will be allocated to the audit of bridge contracts.</p><p>- Funds will be required for setting up multi-node operation when the project goes live.</p><p>- Funds will support the operation and promotion of the cross-chain bridge project.</p><p><br></p><h1>User Manual</h1><p><a href=\"https://defiob.gitbook.io/obridge/instruction-manual\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://defiob.gitbook.io/obridge/instruction-manual</a></p><p><br></p><p>Thank you, everyone!</p>",

"description": "<h2>Overview:</h2><h3>Art is essential in any era, and blockchain has brought many potential transformations to traditional painting art. The ShuFan NFT team has released two projects on Pomelo: the &#34;<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/shufannft\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShuFan NFT Art</a>&#34; project and the &#34;<a href=\"https://pomelo.io/grants/nftart\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA)</a>&#34; project. With the support of the EOS community, we have made visible efforts to promote the value of EOS and invite more artists to join the EOS NFT ecosystem, resulting in some ongoing achievements. This season, we are excited to join Pomelo on Telos and expand these efforts to the Telos blockchain, creating &#34;Artwork NFT on Telos.&#34;</h3><p><br></p><h2>What do we bring to Telos specifically?</h2><h3>1.ShuFan NFT Art will bring more exquisite illustration artworks to the Telos ecosystem, spreading the values of Telos through the form of illustration art. We will support more Telos ecosystem projects through art donations and promote the advantages of NFTs on Telos.</h3><h3>For example, we have already launched an NFT gifting campaign on Telos. The artwork is called &#34;Antelope&#34; NFT. This beautiful artwork is being cross-chain released from EOS to Telos for the first time, and it will be gifted to projects developed on Telos. It can be used for project promotion on Telos and contribute to the development of the Telos ecosystem. After researching NFT platforms on Telos, we found that the most active one is <a href=\"https://kitchenft.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kitchenft.io</a>. It is an NFT platform based on Telos EVM and is similar in form to Opensea. We will distribute our artwork on this platform.</h3><p><br></p><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/2aff9415-a3bf-4d25-a75a-ed20d4656b7d.png\">2.We will attempt to promote the NFT Standard for Traditional Painting Artworks (NS-TPA) in the Telos ecosystem. Leveraging Telos&#39; excellent NFT performance and the immense market potential of art, we aim to better showcase the originality and collectible value of traditional painting artworks while protecting the artistic copyrights of artists and collectors.</h3><p><br></p><h2>Our Plans:</h2><h3>Your support will help us achieve the following plans:</h3><h3>1. Promote the advantages of NFTs on Telos. Continue promoting the advantages of NFTs on Telos through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT\" rel=\"nofollow\">our Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/shufanfree\" rel=\"nofollow\">other public media</a>, accessible to everyone for free. We believe this will help attract more artists, NFT enthusiasts, and art collectors to join the NFT ecosystem on Telos. &#34;<a href=\"https://nftdrop.carrd.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Art NFTs for TELOS community projects (Season 1)</a>&#34; is ongoing.</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/c3e8327e-cb2e-42a0-a2f2-9acb976e9129.jpg\" width=\"301\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/02cbfce0-5832-45db-8c56-329d9ee96961.jpg\" width=\"420\"></p><h3>2. Attempt to promote the use of NS-TPA on Telos, including updating the standard for traditional painting NFTs on Telos to make it more refined and user-friendly. We will also promote and support more artists in adopting this standard to publish their artworks on Telos.</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f1a0f3e5-fbb9-41d0-a026-b171ea9d3170.jpg\"></h3><p><br></p><h2><strong>About ShuFan NFTs:</strong></h2><h3>ShuFan NFT was created by freelance illustrator ShuFan.

"description": "<h3>EOS adopts the DPoS consensus mechanism, which maintains the EOS network by electing 21 super nodes through community voting, providing computing power, bandwidth and storage support for the EOS network. One EOS can be mortgaged into one vote, and one vote can cast a maximum of 30 candidate nodes at the same time. Each candidate node can cast a maximum of 1 vote. Users can change their minds to vote for other candidate nodes at any time, and can apply for the redemption of the mortgaged EOS at any time. Apply for redemption Received after 72 hours.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The development of EOS has been stagnant in the past three years. With the establishment of the EOS Network Foundation, the development of EOS has been on the right track, and many new users have started to invest in EOS again.</h3><h3>At present, the voting rate of the EOS mainnet is around 20%, and the pledge rate of REX is less than 5%. This data is far behind the pledge rate of ETH 2.0. The mechanism of EOS determines that users should put their coins out of the exchanges to vote for the nodes. The higher the voting rate and pledge rate, the more positive for the EOS ecological development.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>Old users have a better understanding of how to vote on EOS and how to pledge EOS into REX. But new users don’t know anything about this, because some media who promoting EOS and some EOS developers have left EOS for too long, and lots of EOS communities have been disbanded, resulting in the lack of various user guides.New users are afraid that their assets will be stolen and phished by phishing websites after withdrawal, so they do not participate in EOS voting.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The voting pools established by each node and proxy are advertised independently. When new users look for new voting pool webpages on the Internet, they may encounter fake voting pools and may be deceived, resulting in loss of assets.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>The sponsor of this project has written a novice voting guide, sorted out and collected the addresses of the voting pools of each node. Will be published on social media platforms. Every new EOS user can learn and understand how to safely generate an EOS account, securely store EOS assets and vote for EOS nodes for free.</h3><h3><br></h3><h3>If POMELO can raise $10,000. An aggregated voting pool will be developed. Users only need to login to one web page with their EOS wallet, select their favorite node voting pool and voting proxy to vote, and conduct real and effective statistics on voting income. Effectively prevent assets from being transferred by phishing websites. This is a free service that helps new EOS users vote and stake.</h3>",

It&#39;s platform-neutral, meaning tokens can be shared on any social media platform.</h3><h2><br></h2><h2>Public welfare of EOSGuild</h2><p>First of all, EOSGuild is a platform that can be used by any community member. EOSGuild will not charge any fee. EOSGuild is of great help to the new project community to quickly improve the community scale, gather popularity and improve community activity. EOSGuild can create a token with one click and air drop it to community members, greatly improving the cohesion of the community. This is very helpful for emerging communities, teams with relatively few technicians, and can solve some early problems in the community. EOSGuild will be fully open source after it goes online and runs stably, including front-end code, server-side code and contract code, with complete development documentation.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solving methods</h2><ul><li><strong>EOSGuild allows you to mint tokens for the community, airdrop them, create an attribution plan for contributors and to provide a bounty for your DAOs, which can effectively guide you through all the options for minting, airdropping, and attributing tokens for your community.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Create your own social token on a fixed supply, federation curve, or attribution schedule Airdrop social tokens through a unique list of available links or addresses.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Discover and grow their community, communicate with and contribute to other creators.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anyone without a code base can complete the issuance and airdrop of tokens through fixed templates, which greatly simplifies the process of project start-up and enables the start-up of various projects to be completed at the most rapid speed.There are two options. One is to create a fixed supply, enter the token name and logo, and pay a certain amount of gas fee to complete the token issue. The other is to issue tokens in the form of a joint curve, with no fixed supply, and the price of tokens increases with supply, helping to reward early holders of tokens.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/b1496bb2-947e-49f9-88ab-efd787ba72ed.png\" width=\"548\"></p>",

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>NFT+ is a tool that helps users to easily create and manage their own NFTs on EOS EVM and EOS. It also helps to increase the value of their NFTs by empowering others to use them.</p><p>NFT is a very interesting field, but it has currently become overly focused on hype about images. Our team has been deeply immersed in the blockchain technology for several years, particularly in the realm of gaming, exploring the application and economic model of NFTs as game materials and assets. With this tool, our goal is to enable owners of NFTs on Ethereum to easily authorize the creation of their NFTs on EOS EVM and EOS with just one single click. NFT+ will not only bring revenue to users, but also attract NFT holders to onboard and build their communities, to establish an active NFT ecology based on EOS EVM and EOS.</p><p><br></p><h2>Plan:</h2><p>Considering the limited budget for season 7, our priority is to complete the development of the creation and management tool. We will be focusing on creating a web tool, which will be accessible to anyone by simply logging in through their wallet.</p><p>Additionally, we will open source once the tool is stable and secure. Developers will be able to utilize and apply it to their own projects according to their needs.</p><p><br></p><p>The development cost will be around 10,000 USDT.</p><p>Including:</p><p>The adjustment of the original NFT protocol (the NFT protocol on Ethereum is too simple to meet the application as material, and the NFT protocol of our developed blockchain game tool is not directly applicable, so it needs to be modified);</p><p>NFT creation and management smart contract;</p><p>Front-end interaction design.</p><p><br></p><h2>Team:</h2><p>We are a technology-oriented team with key members from head tech companies. We first worked on Ethereum then move to EOS and actively developing on EOS for almost 6 years since the mainnet launched. Our goal is to build a fully decentralized cloud gameverse.</p><p><br></p><p>Learn more about our products through this video:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpQ0-FvOv8Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpQ0-FvOv8Q</a></p>",

Shaping our empirical approach we could dismiss the anecdotal emotional despair to the past and finally point to the data and show the world the unmatched technological superiority of EOS, and remind them that the EOS community is battle hardened, and foundation ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Building this technology, we used techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, collecting data from a myriad of sources. We use artificial neural networks at several stages in our analysis to improve the data quality, map text parameters, and classify data from various channels, such as online news and social media.</p><p> </p><p>Then we realised something incredible. This technology could be also used to help build a tool that would allow us to track brand, influencer, crypto and stock sentiments and activity. It would allow us to see how online conversations affected key indicators such as brand sentiment, and the price of cryptocurrencies, stocks, or any asset type. Is there a correlation? Can we use past data to help predict future outcomes? </p><p> </p><p>We decided to go ahead and build it. We then realised it would cost a mountain of cash, and staring at our molehill, we could foresee problems. Thankfully, the EOS Network Foundation believed in our crazy ambitions, and funded us with enough resources to build the platform, so long as we made the EOS version permanently available to everyone in the EOS community, for free.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/15347465-8669-4203-bfbc-3a5501998247.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/17cdd9b6-39bb-45f7-802b-f0937594ec37.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f6518c13-a9c4-49df-b41f-e74df2514ecf.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, we are happy to present the Bywire Audience Intelligence Platform (Launching July 26): <a href=\"https://bywire.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bywire.ai</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introducing Bywire Audience Intelligence (Bywire AI)</strong></p><p> </p><p>Market forces are directed by human or artificial intelligent powered actors, who have common behaviours and repeatable patterns. These are mapped from their decisions, all of which are influenced by their opinions, which are informed by data such as sentiment, probability, and predictability.</p><p> </p><p>This applies to humans and artificial intelligence. But this type of analysis is typically reserved for large corporations given it is expensive to run and maintain. Bywire is aiming to bring this platform to the world, because we believe that this vital information about EOS should remain non-exclusionary and non-rivalrous. </p><p> </p><p>Therefore, we are asking the EOS community to fund this grant application for us to continue to update the data behind the platform, each month. Many parts of the platform are automated, but key elements still require human analysis. Therefore, the funds raised will be used to continue to automate as many functions as possible, reducing the ongoing monthly costs, and to scrape, collect and analyse fresh data each month. </p><p> </p><p>There is also an even bigger benefit. Investors can use this platform to at-a-glance better understand both the growth and potential of EOS, because the data will prove it. No more anecdotal debates, here is the data that shows EOS is a world-beater, and this community is growing.</p><p> </p><p>EOS is returning, and now, finally, we all have the data to prove it. </p><p><em> </em></p><p>~<strong>Costs</strong>:</p><ul><li>Monthly running costs: $3000 ($12,000 target to cover four months)</li><li>Automation development and UI improvements: $10,000 per month ($40,000 target to cover four months)</li><li>Target: $52,000</li></ul><p> </p><h1>Learn more about the Bywire Story</h1><p><br></p>[youtube]qycPsN0D05A[/youtube]<p><br></p>",

"description": "<h1>Our product: “Blockchain Low-Code App Development and Automation”</h1><p>Blockchain low-code app development is the process of creating decentralized applications using a human-readable interface and pre-built components, instead of writing code manually – from prototype to production. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Workflows Templates are part of our Low-Code App solution, and this is our next step in the development and this is why we need your support.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By defining a series of steps through JSON objects, developers can create complex processes that include blockchain transactions and queries. This approach simplifies the development process, reduces the likelihood of errors, and makes it easier for non-technical users to create decentralized applications.</p><h1><br></h1><h1>How our product serves the Public Good</h1><p>Dev3 is an <strong>open-source developer tool, MIT licensed tool</strong>. With our Platform, which is an open-source code, <strong>anyone from the EOS ecosystem can access it</strong> and thus there is no need to develop something from scratch so that the rest of the EOS community can use it to develop new and existing blockchain apps, as well as automate the blockchain process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>It is a non-excludable platform</strong>, which means users from the EOS ecosystem can easily kick-off building &amp; automating blockchain applications easily and for free. </p><p>Also, <strong>the platform is non-rival</strong>, which means that the use of the platform by one person does not prevent access to other people, nor does it reduce the availability to other users from the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>We believe that with our toolkits we provide the possibility for blockchain and non-blockchain developers, and generally, the EOS community, to build on the EOS-EVM network more easily, and thus, through joint collaboration and open access, we increase the value of the EOS network.</p><h1><br></h1><h1>What you&#39;ll be able to build and automate with the Blockchain Low-Code App Platform</h1><p><strong>Build your blockchain app with no coding required</strong></p><p>You will be able to deploy and connect all the necessary smart contracts for the platform such as for real-world asset tokenization, decentralized finance, and NFTs, to blockchain and metaverse games - Dev3 covers all your needs. You can use smart contracts for new blockchain apps or simply extend existing ones by adding blockchain functionality to your existing web and mobile apps.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Automate repetitive blockchain processes</strong></p><p>If you already have some blockchain transactions and are dealing with tedious tasks, simply use the workflow module to automate your repetitive processes.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>We are looking for your support to build the Workflow module within the Platform.</strong></h3><h1><br></h1><h1>What is our Unique Value Proposition</h1><p><strong>Rapid Deployment and Integration of Web3 Apps With Little/no Coding.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Dev3 platform is the ideal developer tool for new Web3 projects and easily onboarding Web2 companies and users.</p><p><br></p><p>Using our Low-code App Development Platform, the EOS community will have the perfect tool for building, maintaining and scaling user-friendly blockchain apps in the best possible UX manner:</p><ul><li>Attract non-blockchain developers to easily build blockchain apps on the EOS-EVM network</li><li>EOS Network will have a tool for rapid proof-of-concept development</li><li>Access to hundreds of smart contracts in human-readable form for easier development</li><li>Import <em>any</em> EVM smart contract address and we will convert it into a human-readable format</li><li>Reduced x10 development costs and the learning curve for companies that want to break into the web3 space.</li></ul><h1><br></h1><h1>What Makes Us Different</h1><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/6ad37f66-42c3-4ff8-9ffa-256e56afee20.png\" width=\"724\"></p><h1><br></h1><h1>4 Key Elements of the Platform</h1><p>There are 4 key elements of the Low-code platform. The first 3 elements have been developed (there is still room for improvement), but the last element - <strong>Workflow</strong>, is the one that remains for development, and then we will have complete automation-ready, not only the development and automation of new blockchain apps and processes but also the automation of existing blockchain apps and process as integration with third parties.</p><p><br></p><p>In a short, these are the key elements of the Blockchain Low-code App Development and Automation Platform:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(1) Dashboard - Intuitive Smart Contract Management</strong></p><p>Dev3 dashboard makes handling smart contracts a breeze.</p><ul><li>Easily handle EVM multi-chain deployments, smart contract versioning and get an auto-generated admin panel for every connected smart contract.</li><li>Enables non-developers to build web3 business logic and deploy smart contracts</li><li>Enables effortless automation of common Web3/Blockchain tasks</li><li>Deploy or connect any EVM deployed smart contract address, and Dev3 will decompile it into a human-readable interface!</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>(2) SDK &amp; API - Connecting Web2 with Web3</strong></p><p>Dev3 SDK &amp; API enable organizations to:</p><ul><li>Keep using their existing tech stack, tools and processes while simultaneously adding blockchain features to their products</li><li>Use traditional web, mobile &amp; backend developers to build Web3 applications</li><li>Write automation scripts for blockchain actions</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>(3) Execution Environment</strong></p><p>Ensure that all blockchain transactions and communications between your app &amp; end users are secure and effortless.</p><p>Developers building on Dev3 and users creating process automation can rely on our class-leading transaction execution UX! Simply by opening a web link, the user is transported into Dev3 Execution Environment! There, Dev3 will detect the smart contract and provide the user with a simple to understand description of what the transaction is about to do! All the user needs to do is wait for the callback API/SDK event!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(4) Workflows (<em>The support we need from you</em>)</strong></p><p>With the Workflows feature, EOS users will be able to automate blockchain actions and easily integrate third-party plugins.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the last, and perhaps the most important element of the Platform <strong>for which we ask for your support</strong>, which fully enables workflow automation and combining &#34;workflow items&#34; from many categories, such as:</p><ul><li>Wallet Authorizations - Authenticate users through cryptographic message signing with Web3 wallets or through custodial wallets</li><li>Deploy and Connect Smart Contracts and Execute Transactions - Add any number of contract deployments and transaction requests into a single, end-to-end business process</li><li>KYC &amp; AML Verification - Stay compliant by easily creating a user registration with KYC &amp; AML verification</li><li>Custodial Wallets - Initializing custodial wallets before entering a flow - ensuring anyone can participate</li><li>Fiat On-Ramp &amp; Off-Ramp - an integrated service that allows users to “Top-Up” their wallets with credit cards</li><li>Digital Signing - Enable your users to digitally sign legal documents as needed</li><li>Multisig - requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a crypto transaction.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>With Dev3 Workflows – you can quickly and easily create templates for any process involving blockchain interactions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>More on this is described below.</strong></p><h1><br></h1><h1>Introduction to Workflow</h1><p>A <strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a series of steps (<strong>blockchain read/write actions</strong>) defined by its JSON file.</p><p>A <strong>Workflow Instance</strong> is a concrete instance created out of a Workflow Template and has its own lifecycle.</p><h1><br></h1><h1>Workflow Template</h1><p>Series of steps describing one complex process.

In order to maintain the authenticity and neutral attitude of the news, we had never accepted any sponsored content, and we will always remain as such.</p><p><br></p><p>In recent years, blockchain games, NFT, and the metaverse have been among the hottest new trends. Running some channels related to EOS, Antelope Coalition, and Trust EVM on JBB.ONE can promote and spread EOS among the people who are interested in crypto and guide new users to onboard the games on EOS. Especially when the community sees GameFi as a major development for the future. Our work will be of great help.</p><p><br></p><p>Monthly cost: About 2000U</p><p><br></p><p>Included:</p><p>An intern responsible for data collection, organization, and editing:</p><p>Collect EOS-related game information and summarize it into a system-importable information sheet</p><p>Collect EOS game data.</p><p>Update and maintain EOS game leaderboards</p><p><br></p><p>Team translators&#39; extra working hours for translation:</p><p>Translate EOS game related news</p><p><br></p><p>Team PRs&#39; extra working hours:</p><p>Make contact with new game project teams in EOS and arrange interviews.</p><p><br></p><p>Function Development:（10,000 U）</p><p>Airdrop function: This feature will help users to make their airdrops on the website in a few simple steps for free.

(Default = original account)</li><li>Claim reward (manual vs automatic)</li><li>See the current APR</li><li>See how much delegators have earned</li><li>See when is the next disbursement</li></ul>",

"description": "<h2><strong> CDao - </strong>A New Voting Platform For Handling Conflicts<strong>      </strong></h2><p><br></p><p><strong>The following content is from machine translation. If you have any questions, please refer to the Chinese version. </strong></p><p><strong>Or contact iunknow@163.com</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you for your attention.</strong></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3><p>CDao is a Dapp running on the EOS.It is a new voting platform that focuses on resolving cognitive conflicts and is open to users on the EOS through smart contracts. In the future,Dapps will be developed for different fields.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong> Issues </strong></h3><p>To deal with the cognitive conflict between the individuals[*1],a common strategy is to use collective decision-making.</p><p><br></p><p>⑴ In existing governance models, a voting system based on the majority principle is a common method for making collective decisions. However, it also has its own problems: </p><p>① Some members may feel that the organization&#39;s decisions are not align with their values or interests, leading to their lack of willingness to participate.</p><p>② Some members may feel that the outcome of their vote will not have a significant impact on the decision, or that they will not be rewarded or motivated enough to cause them to give up their voting rights.</p><p>③ Some members may feel that their voices are not heard or valued, or that the organization&#39;s decisions are unrelated to their interests, resulting to a lack of participation.</p><p>④ Some members may have a sense of engagement but believe that the organization decision-making process is opaque or unfair, or they may believe that members of the organization have personal interests, leading to a lack of trust in the organization. Alternatively, even if they trust the organization, they may argue that the decision-making process lacks effective mechanisms to ensure the reliability and fairness of voting results, leading to a lack of trust in voting results.</p><p><br></p><p>(2) In some areas of community governance, there are also public governance problems that are difficult to balance the interests of all parties, such as &#34;neighbor avoidance effect[*2];&#34; or &#34;reverse neighbor avoidance effect[*3];&#34;.</p><p><br></p><p>(3) In some public creation or heritage processing cases, ownership of an item is clear and shared, but the evaluation of its value by owners is subjective and different, requiring a fair distribution solution. </p><p><br></p><p> It can be seen from the analysis of question （1） that although the voting system based on the majority principle has the advantages of simplicity and high speed, its disadvantages are also obvious. Summarize as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>① The voting method is crude, such as only consent, disapproval or abstention, lacking the ability to describe the strength of consent or disapproval. Comparing a weak 51% and strong 49% may highlight the shortcomings of this system.</p><p>② Lack of incentives in the voting process: lack of appropriate incentives for neutral opinion holders or majority opinion minority holders;</p><p>③ The vote are extremely unfair to the minority opinion holders: the opinions of the minority opinion holders are neither adopted nor compensated;</p><p>④ In some multi-choice areas, the conclusion of voting may be inconsistent: such as the voting paradox[*4];</p><p><br></p><p>For ⑵ problem, most of the governance strategy is also adopt the principle of voting, however, because there are a lot of voting options, in this case, the study of social choice theory shows: based on the majority principle of the voting system, cannot get the consistency of collective preference, such as &#34;arrow impossible theorem&#34; and &#34;pareto improvement impossible theorem&#34; the conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>In the traditional study of welfare economics, inconsistency is a problem that should be greatly avoided, often called a paradox. Although welfare economics after hundreds of years of development, however, to ensure that the consistency of collective preference has been a basic requirement (, of course, the requirement is basically no real implementation), from &#34;arrow impossible theorem&#34; to &#34;pareto improve impossible&#34; as well as a series of social welfare function research, are for the exploration of this consistency.</p><p><br></p><p>In the existing economic research, ensuring the consistency of collective preference is the basic requirement of the fairness of the decision-making. In addition, in the case that the fairness of the decision cannot be guaranteed, it is often necessary to seek the intervention of the government or the third party. However, the question is, can the intervention of the government or the third party guarantee the fairness of the results? That is the problem that ⑶ has to solve. Unfortunately, governments or third parties also struggle to establish a governance strategy compatible with incentives.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the above, the existing theoretical framework is unsatisfactory for dealing with these issues. Therefore, if cognitive conflict (and the resulting inconsistency of group preferences) is an objective necessity, are there other ways to solve the problem? Or, stepping back, do we really need to seek consistent collective preferences? </p><p><br></p><h3><strong>note:</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>[*1] For the same objective things, different people may have different value evaluation, for this objective cognitive conflict, investigate its reason, this may be because of the different language, culture, customs (and the resulting values and beliefs or positions), may also be because of the difference in knowledge background (and the resulting information acquisition and processing differences).</p><p>[*2] an acronym for the phrase &#34;not in my back yard&#34;, is a characterization of opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations. It carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them and that they would tolerate or support it if it were built farther away. The residents are often called nimbys, and their viewpoint is called nimbyism. </p><p>[*3] If the NIMBY effect is the public&#39;s rejection of negative projects, then the anti-NIMBY effect is the public&#39;s fight for positive projects.</p><p>[*4] The Condorcet paradox (also known as the voting paradox or the paradox of voting) in social choice theory is a situation noted by the Marquis de Condorcet in the late 18th century, in which collective preferences can be cyclic, even if the preferences of individual voters are not cyclic. This is paradoxical, because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other: </p><p>Suppose majorities prefer, for example, candidate A over B, B over C, and yet C over A. When this occurs, it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals.Thus an expectation that transitivity on the part of all individuals&#39; preferences should result in transitivity of societal preferences is an example of a fallacy of composition. </p><p>[*5] Arrow&#39;s impossibility theorem: the general possibility theorem or Arrow&#39;s paradox is an impossibility theorem in social choice theory that states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.  </p><p>[*6] Sen&#39;s impossibility of a paretian libertarian theorem: there is no function that can simultaneously satisfy the U *, I *, P *, *, and D *&#34;, where U *is the unrestricted domain, I *is independent and decisive, P *rejects Pareto suboptimal state, and D *is the dictatorship.</p><p>[*7] The Hurwitz theorem: In the personal economic environment, under the condition of participatory constraints (that is, the resulting configuration should be personal rational), there is no effective decentralized economic mechanism (including market competition mechanism) that can lead to the optimal configuration of Pareto and motivate people to display their true information; that is, the optimal configuration of Pareto showing preferences and resources is impossible.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>scheme</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>CDao(Chinese Dao),also can be called China distributed autonomous objectives, gives another answer to the question: CDao takes the concept of &#34;WU WEI&#34; of &#34;DAO DE JING&#34; as the governance concept, using the CDao team in 2011 issued a &#34;super fair distribution model&#34; as a specific algorithm coding model, through Smart contract, collect all participants vote, calculate the final processing results (according to the principle of subjective equality, meet the requirements of all participants).</p><p><br></p><p>First, the solutions provided by CDao are incentive-compatible and also Pareto-optimal. On the surface, this is contradictory to the theory of &#34;true preference is impossible&#34;, however, in CDao, the solution requires independent voting.Therefore, the various voting results can be regarded as completely competitive market behavior, that is, it can be regarded as complete information, which is different from the assumption of &#34;incomplete information&#34;;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Second, CDao is a system that relies on smart contracts with super fair distribution. Because the final governance scheme given by the smart contract requires comprehensive processing of all people, it is a distributed governance technology, and because the final governance scheme does not come directly from anyone (whether the majority opinion or the minority opinion), this governance has the characteristics of a certain centralized system. Therefore, to distinguish it from traditional DAO, we refer to CDao —— as a noncentralized governance technique.&#34;noncentralized&#34; here comes from the concept of &#34;DAO DE JING&#34;,Here, the wisdom of the managers is irrelevant. Because the managers do not need to make any subjective evaluation of the governance problems, but only need to allow the managers to vote on the governance plan themselves. Specifically, CDao and Super Fair smart contracts have the following characteristics:</p><p>① It is value-neutral in theory.</p><p>② It is open source in implementation.</p><p>③ It meets the needs of all participants in the results.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the contradiction of collective preference that it tries to avoid in the theory of welfare economics is exactly the core strategy of problem solving. In CDao, such conflict can not only be handled fairly, but the result is super fair to all participants.</p><p><br></p><p>Below we introduce CDao&#39;s solution —— how it solves the problem without building a consistent collective preference.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>㈠ CDao solution for problem ⑶:</p><p><br></p><p>If a,b,c are ready to split some resources p1,p2,p3.To understand easily, two assumptions are made here:</p><p>⑴ a,b, c, everyone has equal rights and interests;</p><p>The independent evaluation of the utility of p1, p2, and p3 is as follows:</p><p>①a: p1&gt;p2&gt;p3 ②b: p2&gt;p3&gt;p1 ③c: p3&gt;p1&gt;p2;</p><p><br></p><p>CDao first lets everyone to propose a fair distribution scheme (studies have shown that this distribution scheme is exists), then CDao integrates three fair schemes, and finally gives a solution, the distribution results are roughly similar to the following :</p><p>a：p1，b：p2， c：p3</p><p><br></p><p>Here, the subjective super fairness of resource allocation is achieved because both a, b, and c believe that they receive more than the average share. Of course, the core question here is how to accurately divide the appropriate share of p1, p2, and p3 in the resource X.</p><p><br></p><p>Indeed, for partitioned resources, CDao is done through a structured approach. After considering the preferences of all participants, an explicit share was constructed at a time, ensuring that all participants believed that they received the maximum share until the unallocated resources were zero, and finally each participant received the maximum subjective share.</p><p><br></p><p>For inseparable resources, CDao also employs a structural approach that allows each individual to gain an extra super fair share based on the average share, ending with each participant receiving an above-average share. Specific case can be referred to the problem⑵</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>(二) CDao solution for problem (2):</p><p><br></p><p>A town hall decided to build a gymnasium in a city. Although most citizens believe that it is necessary to build a stadium, some citizens believe that the stadium will bring noise and traffic congestion and affect the quality of life of the residents; some citizens worry that the stadium will damage the surrounding environment and landscape and affect the overall image of the community; others believe that the construction of the stadium will occupy a large amount of land resources and affect the development and planning of the community. Therefore, City Hall needs to establish a fair solution.</p><p><br></p><p>For convenience, we will briefly describe the CDao process:</p><p>⑴ City hall lease[*4] , token placement[*5] ;</p><p>⑵ The City Hall has formulated the proposal standard [*6] to collect proposals, for example, to put forward three proposals P1, P2, P3;</p><p>⑶ The City Hall organizes citizens to vote on the motion, assuming that the voting results are as follows:</p><p>P1 received support funds from 40,000 tokens;</p><p>P2 received support funds from 60,000 tokens;</p><p>P3 received support funds from 80,000 tokens;</p><p><br></p><p>(4) Final processing results of CDao:</p><p>① After the smart contract processing, the results are as follows:</p><p>P3 bill passed, paying 70,000 compensation for other bills;</p><p>P2 was compensated by 40,000 tokens;</p><p>P1 was compensated by 30,000 tokens;</p><p><br></p><p>② The super-fairness analysis of the processing results is as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>In the preference world of P1: if other proposals are rejected, each proposal can receive 20,000 compensation (for the other two proposals, the total compensation is 40,000); according to the principle of equality, P1 proposal is rejected and should receive 20,000 compensation, currently 30,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000.</p><p><br></p><p>In the preferred world of P2: if other proposals are rejected, each proposal can receive 30,000(for the other two proposals, the total compensation is 60,000); according to the equality principle;  </p><p>P2 proposal is rejected and should receive 30,000 compensation, currently 40,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000. </p><p><br></p><p>In the world of P3 preference: if the P3 proposal is accepted, the other two schemes should be compensated for 80,000 tokens (the support amount of P3 proposed is the amount of compensation for other proposals); according to the existing calculation, the actual compensation is 70,000, which is over the fair value of 10,000;</p><p><br></p><p>In summary, CDao gives a super-fair calculation that each proposal handles 10,000 more tokens than the fair share.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>⑸ Citizens withdrew their tokens [*8], and the City Hall built the stadium under the P3 proposal:</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, we can see the CDao processing process from the above:</p><p>⑴ Each citizen&#39;s vote can receive a certain voting incentive (the specific incentive amount is related to the number of tokens issued by the government);</p><p>⑵ The voting process is open and transparent, and blockchain technology can ensure tamper results;</p><p>⑶ The voting process is conducted by tokens, which provides some privacy for the team;</p><p>⑷ For each citizen&#39;s own expectations, the vote is super fair;</p><p><br></p><p>(三) CDao solution for problem (1):</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, problem ⑴ is just a special case of problem ⑵. After problem ⑵ is resolved, some conditions existing in problem ⑴ will no longer exist, explained as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>(1) CDao votes with approval and opposition (or abstention), thus surpassing the traditional majority principle. At the same time, since everyone in CDao can cast their own tokens for different proposal, the size of CDao voting can be arbitrarily refined;</p><p>(2) CDao is compatible with incentives during the voting process. As long as each participant ensures that his vote truly reflects his wishes (whether or not), the final result is fair to him;</p><p>(3) The result of CDao voting will compensate all rejected opinions, and the value of the compensation is positively correlated with the opposition force of the voters. The stronger the opposition, the more the compensation;</p><p>(4) The treatment outcome of CDao are unique and not inconsistent.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>NOTE:</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>[*1] LIU CHAO，WANG WENJIE，SUPER FAIR DISTRIBUTION BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE[C]，INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENT CONTROL(ICMSIC 2011),2011-8:368-372</p><p>[*2] Both assumptions are made to handle convenient settings that are not required in the actual processing of CDao.</p><p>[*3] The resulting value depends on the specific utility assessment of a, b, and c for these three items.</p><p>[*4] The tokens for voting are provided by CDao, and City Hall rents tokens from CDao for proposal collection and voting.</p><p>[*5] City Hall provides the sale of tokens, the number of tokens by the city hall, the number of excess tokens sold by citizens (usually does not exceed the number issued, the actual value by the City hall, can be used for final voting incentives or other public operating capital), including the total number of tokens for each citizen is determined by the city hall.</p><p>[*6] City halls can set basic requirements for a vote on bills, such as how many tokens can support them, or decide whether all bills can be voted on.</p><p>[*7] Every citizen can vote to support more than one proposal.</p><p>[*8] In each bill, all participants can be compensated (or refund the supported amount) in proportion to the number of tokens supported through the tokens sold by the City Hall.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>The season target</h3><p><br></p><p>The main goal of this season is to complete the launch of CDao. Specifically, it includes the following functional modules:</p><p><br></p><p>(1) Launch a super-fair distribution contract;</p><p>(2) Launch a proxy voting contract;</p><p>(3) Launch a proxy voting contract;</p><p> </p><p><br></p><h3>Project beneficiaries</h3><p><br></p><p>First, CDao provides services in the form of smart contracts, so its direct beneficiaries are the various Dapps and the service providers behind them, who do not need to redesign the incentive-compatible voting system;</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the design concept of CDao is to meet the needs of all participants, so the ultimate beneficiaries are the various users participating in the voting;</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the end point problem in the traditional welfare economics —— Inconsistent, is just the starting point problem of CDao —— super fairness. Tolerance and equity will be an important cornerstone for the future development of web3. Therefore, CDao will become an important change in the field of distributed self-management, and will also be an important governance model in the field of decentralized management. Therefore, for both community governance and decentralized applications, CDao will help EOS systems take the lead in future web3 development [*1].</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Online time </h3><p><br></p><p>The development plan of the CDao 1.0 version is about three months, and it is scheduled to be delivered online by the end of December 2023. The specific schedule is as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>October 31,2023: Make the interface access documents and complete the system design;</p><p>November 31,2023: Code writing;</p><p>December 15,2023: Test and Audit;</p><p>December 31,2023: Online;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Financing and functional development plan</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>All the funds raised by the project will be used for smart contract development, code audit, project promotion and related hardware facilities upgrading [*2].</p><p><br></p><p>If support time permits, additional work also includes, but is not limited to, the publication of high-quality research papers to expand the impact of CDao and EOS in the field of distributed governance.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Subsequent Development Plans </strong></h3><p><br></p><p>CDao plans to further develop and promote in the following two areas (building DAPPs and corresponding smart contracts): </p><p><br></p><p>(1)Building a price discovery system for on-chain assets: </p><p>Construct a mediated trading system with third-party guarantees to discover the price of on-chain assets. Different guarantors can enjoy different guarantee commissions and have different guarantee obligations based on their guarantee prices. When there is cognitive bias for assets, it can reduce the trial-and-error risk for all participants. </p><p><br></p><p>(2)Building a conflict resolution system for the NIMBY problem:</p><p> Construct a small-scale voting system (targeting not only DAO organizations) that includes functions such as proposal collection and voting. The collection and voting for each proposal are completed through tokens, and for any participant, one of the following situations will occur: </p><p>1) their proposal is accepted by others, and their voting bid is compensation for others (after the smart contract calculation, any surplus will be returned to their account, which CDao ensures will be returned); </p><p>2) their proposal is not accepted by others, and they will enjoy compensation from others based on their proposal (in general, the compensation price is slightly higher than their proposal price. CDao guarantees that according to the principle of equality, the compensation received by participants must be higher than their proposal price). </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Long-term Planning </strong></p><p><br></p><p>CDao&#39;s long-term operating plan includes (if you have a development team in the relevant area, you can also contact us for cooperation):</p><p><br></p><p>(1) Provide fair voting solutions for DAO or non-DAO organizations, and develop the corresponding DAPP;</p><p>(2) Provide complete conflict solutions for NIMBY or anti-NIMBY problems, and develop corresponding DAPP;</p><p>(3) Although the CDao theory is based on separable resources, the existing application sites are mostly based on nonseparable resources. Therefore, in the future, there may be provided (mainly focusing on visual processing) and develop corresponding DAPP.</p><p>(4) Although many people currently believe that supernodes affect the decentralization of EOS, we believe that EOS will become the best practice place for CDao as long as the underlying consensus protocol is adjusted appropriately. So, in the future, we may provide some suggestions for community governance in order to expand the number of super nodes and ensure the super fair distribution between the super nodes.</p><p><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>Other Information</h3><p><br></p><p>The CDao team members have rich experience in C++ application development and project management for over ten years.

We also appreciate your time to read and understand our proposal! If you like this plan, please share our project.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for the magic of crowdfunding.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>NOTE:</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>[*1]CDao and Eden have something in common: </p><p>First, both are based on the concept of fair division, </p><p>and second, both require the voting opinions of all participants.</p><p>but, The differences are also clear: </p><p>first, In the form, Eden&#39;s final decision is obtained from a fixed number of small groups, The CDao is much more open, Its groups can consof arbitrary individuals, One person can also form a group, Even the final result can be decided by only one vote; </p><p>second, From a process point of view, The final decision plan chosen by Eden was based on a envy-free decision with a random review system, The CDao is based on a neutral smart contract, And calculate a new super-fair decision; </p><p>third, From the results, Eden is based on the envy-free division , CDao is based on the supper-fair distribution, The difference between the two is that,</p><p>In a case of division, It is possible that there are many envy-free division schemes available, But there is only one super-fair distribution scheme, The smart contract of super-fair distribution guarantees the uniqueness and impartiality of the distribution scheme.</p><p><br></p><p>[*2] No matter how much money is raised, the project will continue to move forward and go online on schedule.</p>",

"summary": "decentralized e-commerce",
"description": "<p>Introduction</p><p>In recent years, both the Internet and e-commerce platforms have experienced development from decentralization to centralization. With the advent of WEB3 era, users’ requirements for information security and awareness of privacy protection have gradually been improved.</p><p>In addition, the supervision of intellectual property rights in the globe has also been increasingly emphasized, and with the arrival of the era of blockchain and digital currency, disadvantages of traditional e-commerce platforms are conspicuously exposed.</p><p>StoreOS aims to build a pure decentralized e-commerce system, it can be used by all users with an EOS account. In the future, it will be open source, available to all users and enterprises for deployment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why do we need a new e-commerce architecture based on blockchain?</strong></p><p>Centralized systems should be maintained in traditional e-commerce platforms, so as to protect users’ information security, deal with intellectual property complaints, and carry out anti-corruption within enterprises, which results in huge costs, and these costs will eventually be transferred to the merchants and consumers. Under such circumstance, it is imperative to explore a new architecture with higher efficiency and lower loss.</p><p>StoreOS is based on WEB3, and there is no need to verify personal information like mobile phone and e-mail address when registering. The decentralized front-end layout is adopted, and there is no centralized database, thus no releasable information of users will be stored.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optimization of the economic model:</strong></p><p>The economic model of traditional e-commerce has resulted in the elimination of small and medium-sized businesses under the same category, and resources was continuously concentrated to the top end. The current development situation is not consistent with the universal values of antitrust, common prosperity, as well as a community of shared future for human beings.</p><p>Based on WEB3, StoreOS will be committed to decentralization and equality, so as to eliminate the inequality resulting from platform advantages or poor information, and so that the market can optimize itself according to the conditions of the supply and demand sides.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Promotion and optimization:</strong></p><p>Generally, competitive ranking or booth bidding is adopted by traditional e-commerce.</p><p>The overall architecture of StoreOS is distributed and does not provide a centralized or manually adjusted aggregation display. A decentralized promotion platform will be built, and the hash algorithm based on blockchain will be used as superimposing to fixed weight logic, so as to achieve a fairer random display and promotion.</p><p>No matter what the future of the project is, our team promises that it will never offer bidding competitive ranking using the advantages of the platform. We believe in <strong>Decentralized Algorithm &gt; Centralized Algorithm &gt; People</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Optimization of the community incentive:</strong></p><p>There is little community incentive in traditional e-commerce platforms, or the incentive of the platform is actually taking profits from merchants, and the gain of platform through activities is far greater than that of merchants.</p><p>In blockchain projects, community participation is of crucial importance. The incentive model consists of the incentives of merchants, purchasers, as well as other pan users, which will be disclosed in the whitepaper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Settlement advantages of smart contracts:</strong></p><p>As we all know, smart contracts are completely settled on the blockchain, its relatively centralized settlement method is more open, transparent, efficient and instant. Particularly, EOS, a high-performance blockchain with negligible transaction costs, has a block confirmation speed of 0.5 seconds, which can perfectly carry the e-commerce platform under the new framework.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Roadmap</strong>:</p><p>1. PRD(Project Requirements Documents) of StoreOS, detailed functional flow charts and descriptions.</p><p>2. Core payment API and the development of smart contract.</p><p>3. More contract logic development, such as payment confirmation by the purchaser, delayed payment, etc.</p><p>4. Development of smart contract for the e-commerce platform.</p><p>5. Merchant Dashboard, including IPFS one click deployment, as well as full UI realization.</p><p>6. Front-end development for merchants</p><p>7. Communication system between merchants and users</p><p>8. Platform aggregation promotion display system</p>",

Eden Town Halls provide a helpful platform for community members to promote their work, share their thoughts in inspiring conversations, and enjoy fun times with talented builders. We discuss a wide range of topics, including EOS, Eden, Web3, creativity, and much more. In addition to hosting open discussions, we prepare an exciting agenda in collaboration with our guests and record visually engaging shows with high production value each week. We publish the videos for each episode with attractive artwork and detailed show notes, including timestamps, highlights, and related links. </p><p><br></p><p>Eden Town Halls are hosted by <a href=\"https://dansingjoy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dan Singjoy</a>. Since starting the town halls in mid-2022, we’ve hosted over 52 meetings and countless hours of fascinating conversations with many of the most innovative leaders in Web3. You can learn more about Eden Town Halls at <a href=\"http://EdenTownHall.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">EdenTownHall.com</a> and watch all previous shows at <a href=\"http://EdenTownHall.com/episodes\" rel=\"nofollow\">EdenTownHall.com/episodes</a>.

We love to host amazing experiences and create educational content to help empower communities, but we are currently underfunded and need help to maximize benefits for all.</p><p><br></p><p>All video, curation, and production work is currently being done on a volunteer basis by Dan Singjoy. With only one volunteer and limited funding, we have not been able to maintain a consistent release schedule of episodes or allocate many resources towards promoting the town halls. For example, we’ve recorded five stellar shows that have yet to be published since early February, we haven’t had time to promote the show with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCreators_/status/1614458267769372674\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweet</a> since January, and we haven’t had time to produce a short <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdenCreators_/status/1592379445612281856\" rel=\"nofollow\">video clip</a> since November.</p><p><br></p><p>Eden Town Halls have been greatly increasing in quality with each episode and these meetings have the potential to create immense benefits for all communities in the near future. We have exciting visions to produce dozens of high-quality, educational, and entertaining video clips each week with the power of <a href=\"https://edentownhall.com/37\" rel=\"nofollow\">DAMS</a>. We plan to use the unique benefits of EOS consensus games to pioneer new forms of collaborative video creation, expand our distribution to mainstream audiences, and help everyone cooperate better than ever before.</p><p><br></p><p>With your help, we can raise the funding needed to pay for our expenses and continue the show in a sustainable manner. With additional funding we can hire video editors, content curators, and marketers to help Eden Town Halls reach their full potential. We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming town hall and sharing amazing experiences to empower communities.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your consideration!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>[youtube]F89YOeWb91w[/youtube]",

"description": "<p>No matter how powerful a person is, if they are isolated from human society and the system of division of labor and cooperation, they are at best similar to the king of beasts in the wild, still needing to rough it. Modern city dwellers like us don&#39;t need to be super strong – we live in skyscrapers built by thousands of people collaborating together and eating delicious steaks delivered to our tables by thousands of people providing service. All we may do is sit in front of a computer to type or speak in front of others. We are weak compared to the king of beasts, but we live a life that they can never enjoy. The secret behind this is our human system of labor division and cooperation.</p><p><br></p><p>The labor division and cooperation enable 1+1 to exceed 2, not only for our entire human society but also for the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem. Reasonable labor division and collaboration between all members of the EOS native and EOS EVM ecosystem will bring infinite value to the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>EDAO is also created based on promoting cooperation among community members with the goal of adding value to the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem by facilitating members&#39; cooperation and promoting the prosperity of the EOS native and EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, many people in the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem community want to contribute to the ecosystem but don&#39;t know where to start. It is even more difficult when it involves cross-language international cooperation. EDAO focuses on improving efficiency within the EOS native and EOS EVM ecosystem and is <strong>free and open to entire EOS native and EOS EVM ecosystem communities</strong>, making the cooperative process more reliable and efficient.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Why Is EDAO a Public Good?</strong></h1><p><br></p><p>EDAO is built on a decentralized task system and anyone can freely and for free publish or accept tasks. It serves as a public and open bridge for all projects in the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem that require task distribution and for all community members who are willing to contribute to the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>EDAO is a non-profit organization, and all payments made by task publishers and other income sources are fairly and transparently distributed to community members who complete tasks and participate in the system&#39;s operation. No specific individuals or organizations have any special profit rights.</p><p><br></p><p>EDAO aims to reduce the difficulty of finding community support for projects in the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem and lower the threshold for community members to participate in EOS construction, promotion, and cooperation. We have written many SOPs to help community members easily identify tasks they can contribute to and join EDAO in building the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>All information in EDAO, such as task details, completion progress, and completion quality, is clearly listed and transparently disclosed. Everyone can supervise the operation of EDAO.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time, everyone can easily determine what EDAO can do, what they can do in EDAO, and the quality of EDAO&#39;s work output.</p><p>Clear, transparent, and public operating methods can also help everyone determine each member&#39;s skills and willingness more clearly. This will significantly improve the efficiency of DAO.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1><strong>What Has EDAO Achieved?</strong></h1><p><br></p><p>Since May 2022, we have released 52 EOS mainnet and EOS EVM-related tasks to the community, holding a consensus rating meeting every two weeks, and reaching a consensus among community members who have completed tasks during each cycle to allocate EDAO points.</p><p><br></p><p>Since May 2022, we have been continuously collecting news and information about the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem on our Discord channel, providing a news aggregation platform for all community members. Anyone can join our Discord to keep up with EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem news and information in a timely manner.</p><p><br></p><p>The EDAO matching community project collaborates with members in the community to accelerate the development of community projects.</p><p>Starting from March 2023, the channel for collecting ecosystem news and information will be upgraded to the &#34;EOS Ecosystem News Forum&#34;, presenting EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem information in the form of forum posts, classifying information by tags, and allowing all community members to express their opinions on the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Since August 2022, we have held Weekly Community Meetings every Sunday night at 8 pm, lasting 1-1.5 hours each time, reviewing and discussing topics related to the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, 152 people have joined EDAO, making contributions to the EOS mainnet and EOS EVM ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For more details, such as allocation methods, incentive models, etc., please click the link below:</p><p><a href=\"https://edencn.notion.site/EdenCN-DAO-c5e66e32328348d980ff4032c9b1e38c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://edencn.notion.site/EdenCN-DAO-c5e66e32328348d980ff4032c9b1e38c</a></p><p><br></p><p>Task Board:</p><p><a href=\"https://edencn.notion.site/Task-Board-80a8d7d3c6a04881a6e2bda4cce756c1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://edencn.notion.site/Task-Board-80a8d7d3c6a04881a6e2bda4cce756c1</a></p><p><br></p><p>Points Reward Distribution Publicity:</p><p><a href=\"https://edencn.notion.site/EDAO-04765d2a35cf4d25a7ab7cd6183a910a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://edencn.notion.site/EDAO-04765d2a35cf4d25a7ab7cd6183a910a</a></p><p><br></p><p>Discord:</p><p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/CypnTuuf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/CypnTuuf</a></p>",

There are risks of the platform going bankrupt and being regulated.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> The project team lacks a supervision mechanism and lacks an audit of the use of funds.</em></p><p><strong><em>3.</em></strong><em> Investors participating in crowdfunding have no incentive mechanism and are not highly motivated.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em>The work progress of the funded team is not limited.</em></p><p> </p><p>We will use EOS smart contracts to develop a decentralized crowdfunding platform.</p><p> </p><h4>Fund Management Design:</h4><p>Fund management is decentralized and hosted in a smart contract. After the development is completed, our team will give up the transfer authority of the smart contract hosting the funds. Give the authority to the EOS nodes for multi-signature management or black hole. Our team will not have the authority to transfer investors&#39; funds.</p><p> </p><h4>Basic design:</h4><p>Crowdfunding funds will be unlocked in batches depending on investor votes:</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is an open platform where anyone can initiate a project and seek investor support.</em></p><p><strong><em>2. </em></strong><em>Project teams that accept crowdfunding must set the upper and lower limits of the crowdfunding amount. When the lower limit is reached, the project is deemed to be launched, and the investor&#39;s funds will be locked in the smart contract, waiting to be unlocked in batches. If the expiration date does not exceed the lower limit, the project will be considered a failed crowdfunding. It needs to be restarted and the investor can get his funds (EOS) back from the smart contract.</em></p><p><strong><em>3. </em></strong><em>Teams that accept crowdfunding must reach the set delivery goals and apply for unlocked funds. Project funds are unlocked in batches, and all investors need to vote through smart contracts to unlock funds to the project team in batches.</em></p><p><strong><em>4.</em></strong><em> Investor voting weight is realized through algorithm. The algorithm will find a balance of weights between large and small investors. When a certain turnout is reached, the smart contract will release funds to the project party. The algorithm formula will be fully open sourced on Github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Innovative design:</h4><p>We designed the one-time unlocking mode, which is different from the batch-based unlocking mode.</p><p> </p><p>Project teams that accept crowdfunding can set up a result of working first,then receiving funds. When the project team achieve the goal, then the investors vote to approve it, the crowdfunding funds will be released at one time.This design is for the project team that accepts crowdfunding to make promises and products that are beneficial to investors, and after self-funding to complete the goal, a one-time vote to release all the crowdfunding funds to the project team.This innovative design allows crowdfunding while working. With the progress and development of the project, more and more people will participate in crowdfunding, and the project team will receive more funds at one time.</p><p> </p><h4>Public Goods Section:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>This is a project that one person can participate in. There is no curtain. Anyone can publish the project and accept crowdfunding. Anyone can become an investor.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em> All parts of the project involving smart contracts and algorithms will be open sourced and removed on github.</em></p><p> </p><h4>Benefits to the EOS ecosystem:</h4><p><strong><em>1. </em></strong><em>Smart contracts are developed and deployed in the main network. Crowdfunding EOS uses EOS as the base currency, and T contains USD on EOS.</em></p><p><strong><em>2.</em></strong><em>This crowdfunding platform will first serve the project teams of the EOS community and help EOS projects.

"summary": "Artreus is a decentralized exchange appstore for tokenized apps, games, game assets and app pluggins.",
"description": "<p>WHAT IS ARTREUS</p><p><br></p><p>Artreus aims to solve the lack of transparency and control in the traditional app/game market. In centralized appstores, app developers have limited control over the fees and revenue share agreements with appstore operators. Another problem Artreus tends to solve is lack of user control over apps or games, security and privacy. An Appstore built using the blockchain tends to be more secured as all transaction, app itself will be stored in a blockchain network. In centralized appstores, users&#39; personal data and app usage habits are often collected and shared with third parties without their consent, this often lead to data misuse. But on Artreus store, Users own their apps or game and the data in it, which they can resell for profit or share with friends.</p><p><br></p><p>One major feature that sets the Artreus store apart from every other store is the limited supply feature introducing the power of scarcity in apps and games industry. Traditional app marketplaces have been saturated with a seemingly infinite number of application, leading to a dilution of value. At Artreus store, we model after the bitcoin technology by introducing the idea of limiting the supply of apps listed. We restore the essence of rarity, breathing value to the app and game industry. Users who purchase apps on the Artreus store Own those apps, they would be part of the many others who bought into the value of a project. This can only be on Artreus.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Why Artreus store?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. Scarcity-driven Frenzy:</p><p>Imagine an appstore where each listed app possesses limited supply. This scarcity-driven model instantly transforms the value proposition of every application. Users become captivated by the allure of possessing an exclusive digital gem, fueling their desire to be among the select few who own it. This creates an ecosystem where rarity amplifies desirability, setting the stage for a new era of app discovery and appreciation.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Unleashing Developer Creativity:</p><p>For developers, our decentralized appstore offers a fertile ground for unrestricted creativity. By introducing limited supply, we ignite a spark of inspiration, challenging developers to craft apps that stand out from the crowd. With the fear of being lost in the sea of countless alternatives eliminated, developers can unleash their imaginations, pushing boundaries, and redefining what&#39;s possible in the app world.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Transparency and Trust:</p><p>Blockchain forms the backbone of our decentralized appstore, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Every transaction, every download, and every interaction is recorded on the distributed ledger, leaving no room for doubt or manipulation. Users can trust the authenticity of listed apps, knowing that each is a unique digital asset with limited availability. The era of counterfeit or unauthorized distribution is consigned to the past.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Enhanced Value and Appreciation:</p><p>By embracing limited supply, we restore value to the app marketplace. Each app becomes a coveted gem, a digital masterpiece that users cherish. The limited availability creates a sense of urgency, prompting users to seize the opportunity before it&#39;s gone. This elevation of value benefits both users and developers, fostering a thriving ecosystem that appreciates true innovation.</p><p>6. Security and privacy: The blockchain technology has enhance securing of digital assets. Its regarded as the most secured technology as at now. We have utilized this opportunity by improving the apps and games industry security by storing all apps, games and its data in the blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Artreus Store offers several public goods and benefits to users. Here are some of them:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Increased Accessibility: Artreus store allows developers from anywhere in the world to publish their apps or games without any central authority or gatekeeper. This enables greater accessibility to a wide range of applications, promoting diversity and innovation.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Censorship Resistance: Artreus stores operate on blockchain technology, which ensures a high level of censorship resistance. Apps cannot be arbitrarily removed or censored by any central authority, providing users with greater freedom of choice, expression and control.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Enhanced Security and Privacy: Tokenizing apps or games on a Artreus store can improve security and privacy. By leveraging blockchain&#39;s distributed ledger and cryptographic features, users can have greater control over their data and transactions. Additionally, the use of smart contracts can facilitate secure and transparent app interactions.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Transparent Governance: Many decentralized app stores utilize decentralized governance mechanisms. This means that users have a say in the decision-making processes, such as app listings, updates, and community guidelines. Transparent governance fosters trust, fairness, and accountability within the app store ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Incentivized Development: Tokenizing apps or games through the use of utility tokens or cryptocurrencies can incentivize developers to create high-quality applications. With our community driven dappstore, Developers earn directly from what is earned from their apps/games.</p><p><br></p><p>6. User-driven Economy: Tokenization enables the establishment of a user-driven economy within the Artreus store ecosystem. Users can buy, sell, and trade apps, games, or other digital assets. This peer-to-peer economy can foster entrepreneurship, reward user engagement, and create new economic opportunities for participants.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Reduced Monopolistic Power: Traditional centralized app stores are often controlled by a single entity, leading to a monopolistic environment. The Artreus store disrupts this concentration of power by providing a platform where multiple developers and users can participate on an equal footing. This promotes competition, prevents unfair practices, and encourages a healthy and diverse app ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Global Collaboration: The Artreus Store breaks down geographical barriers and facilitates global collaboration. Developers and users from different parts of the world can connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on innovative projects. This collaborative environment can lead to the </p><p>creation of unique and culturally diverse applications.</p><p><br></p><p>9. Easily Accessible: Imagine a place where all applications are not censored because of your geographical location or censored for selfish motives. A decentralized rulings of the internet, applications freely accessible by anyone and everyone. Everyone detecting how they want to see the internet</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In summary, Artreus store offers public goods such as increased accessibility, censorship resistance, enhanced security and privacy, transparent governance, incentivized development, user-driven economy, reduced monopolistic power, and global collaboration. Tokenizing apps or games within this ecosystem further benefits users by providing economic incentives, fostering innovation, and empowering individuals within the digital marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>Medium blog: https://medium.com/@officialartreus</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>our twitter page</p><p>https://twitter.com/OfficialArtreus</p><p><br></p><p>repo: https://github.com/Artreus-Organization(open source)</p><p><br></p><p>our demo video: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpmm99T1hgidGW57lGSEca2kwDsdk0k1N</p><p><br></p><p>Demo site</p><p>http://artreus.io our live page site(only on desktop view)</p><p><br></p><p>Pitch deck link:https://eu.docworkspace.com/d/sIOKKjrrdAd-1h6gG</p><p><br></p><p>Pitch video</p><p>https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuLRJC5Z8/ImfMcZKHBKyKCb6WdYnWmQ/watch?utm_content=DAFuLRJC5Z8&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink</p>",

"description": "<h2>Description:</h2><p><br></p><p>Did you know that data 35,000 feet above earth&#39;s surface is already located directly on chain? The Kanda Weather Group began in Africa and has been launching weather balloons and collecting data from a global network of 22 ground sensors hosted by community members.</p><p><br></p><p>Don&#39;t believe us? Check out our live data on Telos here <a href=\"https://explorer.telos.net/account/ascendweathr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://explorer.telos.net/account/ascendweathr</a></p><p><br></p><p>For two year, we&#39;ve been flying weather balloons and doing educational activities with students in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon to teach university students how to build technologies using LoRaWAN and eosio that close the gaps in climate data coverage that government agencies have failed to fill. To date, we&#39;ve done over 25 demonstration launches using locally sourced materials and 3D-printed payloads.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out our Project Pitch below:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPq4KILNolo</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;ve done several blockchain community events, including hackathons with Taikai and Omdena:</p><p>https://taikai.network/en/kanda-weather-group/hackathons/kanda-weather/overview</p><p>https://omdena.com/blog/weather-balloons-to-predict-rainfall/</p><p><br></p><p>Not only is this weather project a real-world use case for eosio, but it&#39;s also a demonstration of the speed and agility of eosio to host data from real-world sensors called IoT devices. During our research, we&#39;ve seen how most radio technologies use end-to-end encryption for security. This makes a lot of sense in use cases like cellular communication, but what about public weather sensors? Why send it encrypted if you want the data to be open anyway? This is where we think blockchain digital signatures are a perfect fit!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Use of Funds:</h2><ol><li>Twenty weather balloon launches done with our newly set up hydrogen station in Douala, Cameroon</li><li>Analysis of eosio codebase to find how new Mandel p2p protocol can be improved to onboard thousands of IoT devices with poor network connectivity</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>Q&amp;A:</h2><p><br></p><h3>Who are the main team members?</h3><p>My name is Nicolas Lopez and I have 5 years cumulative experience at Boeing and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a software engineer and scientific programmer on the GOES-16 weather satellite. I have a strong professional weather and climate background and am a genesis EOS account holder (guztgmbsgige).</p><p><br></p><p>My colleague Dessap Loic lives in France and is traveling to Cameroon to guide the education activities. He has his own company RobotSave and operates a drone education affiliate called Cameroon Flying Labs. He&#39;s done many technology demonstrations with underserved communities in Africa.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>How does data from the weather sensors get to the blockchain?</h3><p>We use a low-power network called LoRaWAN that transmits temperature, pressure, and humidity data a maximum of 10 kilometers to community gateways.

"description": "<p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We have witnessed a lot of development on Telos, and many products try to venture, work hard, and fail because of a lack of community support. It is mostly the case with small teams with a lack of marketing bandwidth, trying to do crazy things but failing cause of no bandwidth or budget for marketing their development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Result </strong>- Poor feedback cycle, poor experience for builders, and loss of business from Telos to other Blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Good</strong> - We will provide the tools available to users free of cost, which includes listing your communities, quests, discord community management, staking and farming of NFTs and tokens (will be adding this to the smart contract), utility giveaway inspired by tropee.com, automating NFTs and FTs giveaways and analytics to help new project see how the quests are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>We won&#39;t be using the funds from Grant to fill our global reward pool. Though, the projects could pay for banners and sponsorships for better visibility which we shall be used to fill the reward pools until the project is standalone and have traction for the projects to see the value in Zila.</p><p><br></p><p>Our priority is to help projects succeed on Antelope blockchains and create a network effect of community building for the chains, reducing time in marketing and community reach out. It&#39;s a win-win for Telos and other blockchains combined.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Zila is building a platform where users could discover new communities listed on Telos (the communities could be new products, new services, influencers, or individual communities), help the community grow by following certain quests or tasks, and earn rewards in exchange. Any member who completes a certain task will be rewarded with Zila points (virtual for now) which get him into the local and global leader board.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits </strong></p><p><br></p><p>A directory for outside members to see how projects are doing on Telos. </p><p>Less time spend on marketing and community building. </p><p>Tools to reward loyal members. </p><p>Enabling the staking and farming of NFTs and FTs provides better economic values for all the stakeholders combined. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/1b818aba-8469-4255-864f-e202e328a5af.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community Trust </strong>- The communities listed will both be verified and non-verified (by Zila admin on Telos Blockchain) and could be upvoted or flagged by community members enabling more trust for other members to join. Only Zila NFT Pass holders will have the authority to upvote/flag communities which reduces spamming and bot account networks.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/e9d8dc0f-a1c0-4f83-bded-31363c1b50e6.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rewards and Utilities</strong> - Community Owners will be able to reward the community members with NFTs, Tokens, and whitelisting, and also have them claim Utilities like Merchandise (to segment an audience holding a certain number of tokens or NFTs in their account), Premium Event Links, Promo Codes, Content, Files, vIRLs and much more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bots</strong> - The platform will be connected with the Discord Community of projects with the help of the Zila bot, which could read the roles of members on Discord, and their activity and build the task for members with segmented roles, the bot could also award the members with better roles as they complete different quests.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow </strong>- Users will be able to follow other users and get notified when certain users complete a certain task. Also, a telegram bot will help them notifying with new communities getting listed on Telos Blockchain. So they could join their community, help them with feedback and claim rewards both locally (given by the community) and globally (given by Zila).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward Pools</strong> - We are working on adding Reward pools in which both new and existing products could transfer rewards in exchange for banners and other perks. When a user completes a certain number of quests across all the communities gets some reward from the pool. The pools incentivize the members to keep on exploring new communities and help bring new audiences for all the new projects. It&#39;s a win for the entire Telos community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discussion</strong> - Members will also have a place to get involved in threaded discussions much like Reddit within the Zila community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shops</strong> - Communities will be able to set up their own NFT Shop for selling NFTs directly to users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Smart Contract </strong>- community names, upvotes, and flags are pushed on Blockchain. Users are also verified on Blockchain. We are working on adding pools and milestones.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Task/Quest include </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Telegram(Join community)</p><p>Discord (Join Server)</p><p>Twitch (Subscribe/Follow)</p><p>Daily Streak (Points for showing up on the community daily)</p><p>Questionnaire (feedback/market research)</p><p>Quizzes</p><p>Upload images/links</p><p>Share docs</p><p>Share links</p><p>Invite other members</p><p>Share leads</p><p>Share Ideas</p><p>and much much more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where are we now? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>We have released the Beta version of the platform on WAX Blockchain, idea is to make it a hub for the entire Antelope space to come together and help push products building on top.

I would like to change this, to be specific, make about 10 ~ 20 videos about EOS, in one season.

What is more important, they are curious about new things and represent the future, of nearly everything.</p><p><br></p><p>EOS is now in lacks of users, and Bilibili is a must. And our videos can be reached and watched by anyone, without any limitations.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Why can we do it?</strong></h1><p>I used to get stuck on creating an EOS wallet. After some hard work, I solved the problem, but encountered another one: I could not find a way to transfer my tokens to others. CPU, NET, RAM, they are all new to me and it took a long time to fully enjoy the benefits of EOS.</p><p><br></p><p>All the hard word I have done, is what everyone else would encounter. I would like to share my experience, make videos about it, keep updating and replying comments in this season.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to raise about 10k USD, to fulfill the ambition; all the materials will be available across the Internet, for all users.</p><p><br></p><p>And all uses and readers are welcome to offer help and share their experiences, as part of the open community.</p>",

"description": "<h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Blockchain Floripa is a community focusing on bringing more open, free to attend in-person events to the cryptocurrency community in Brazil, bringing more awareness to the EOS ecosystem, supporting the development of EOS projects by highlighting them and providing them a platform to share information with people in-person.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of hosting the weekly crypto meetups on the island - which is known as &#39;The Silicon Island&#39; for being Brazil’s Tech powerhouse, we host big events like Floripa Crypto Day 1, 2 and Blockchain Floripa.</p><p><br></p><p>In Floripa Crypto Day 2, our next event, we will have a few workshops by multiple projects of the EOS ecosystem: Upland, EOS Rio, FIO Protocol.. Our aim is to feature EOS and the Antelope chain in a grand way to the Brazilian scene.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>What is the issue?</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>There is a lot of information about cryptocurrency in general and the EOS ecosystem specifically online in the English language. However, there is a lack of information and support for people new to EOS available online in Portuguese and Spanish even though the sector is experiencing massive growth in Latin America in general and Brazil in particular.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, meetups and workshops are a perfect tool to raise awareness about EOS.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>How will we solve this?</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>When you are new to something which can be intimidating like financial technologies or even new revolutionary tech such as EOS, it is much easier and more reassuring to meet with people who are knowledgeable and can guide you through onboarding to the ecosystem and learning about it in person; especially if they speak your native language.</p><p><br></p><p>We want to bring in-person events to Florianopolis in Brazil. These events will be free to attend for everyone and will allow us to:</p><p><br></p><p>- Provide EOS projects an opportunity to spread awareness about their products and services, as well as to demonstrate how they work to both current EOS community members and others.</p><p><br></p><p>- Provide a fun event for people new to EOS and cryptocurrencies in general to learn about the Ecosystem, meet others and receive useful advice to help them get started on their EOS journey.</p><p><br></p><p>- Provide a place for EOS community members to meet, share ideas and help each other with working on their various projects which seek to benefit the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>- Create amazing content about the event and the workshops about EOS, and EOS-based projects. </p><p><br></p><p>- Get influencer posts and articles about the event and the projects involved to add exposure (Beincrypto.com is one of the participants for example).</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>What we have worked on so far</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Our next event is being hosted on 10 December 2022 and is called ‘Floripa Crypto Day 2’. We have booked a large auditorium where projects are able to spread awareness and understanding of their projects on stage.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, we have secured an incredible Networking area that counts with a massive poolside bar, surrounded by palm trees. Thus combining amazing location for the videos, and at the same time allowing the local crypto community to network while having an unforgivable experience.</p><p><br></p><p>We want them to leave thinking ‘Those EOS events are the best’.</p><p><br></p><p>And lastly, we rented a beach bar right at the beach for a Blockchain party area designed to enhance the Crypto festival experience (not too dissimilar to Bitcoin Miami, NFT LA..etc)</p><p><br></p><p>There will be a fireshow, dance show, DJs and much more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To help make this event a success and spread awareness for the EOS ecosystem, we have already:</p><p><br></p><p>- Arranged for news organization Beincrypto to be a partner of the event. Not only will the write a press-release, but they will be filming interviews and sharing highlights from the event about the various projects. On top of that, they offered to write two articles, one about the event itself.. And one about a sponsor of our choice which will be of course EOS.We believe this will be fantastic for spreading awareness of the EOSIO ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>- EOS projects are going to be present on stage and spread awareness of both their projects and the ecosystem at large during the event. Upland for example is a metaverse of virtual real estate built upon the EOS blockchain with over 4 million active users.</p><p><br></p><p>- Next to the pool and bar area, we will display some custom designed graphic banners, which of course display the EOS logo.</p><p><br></p><p>- On our Instagram you can see our after video from our first event sponsored by FIO here <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfsAeZOjobf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfsAeZOjobf/</a> . We will make sure to highlight EOS in this next after video, which will be professionally edited.</p><p><br></p><p>- Before our event we are creating custom videos talking about crypto projects involved, such as this one here <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ClJhOhEOLGO/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/p/ClJhOhEOLGO/</a> - we would like to do the same for EOS, bringing people towards the community.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>Why we need your support</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>So far we have obtained paid sponsorships from some cryptocurrency projects, however the funds raised are only enough to cover the costs of the venue, printing of banners and not much else.</p><p><br></p><p>We want to raise funds that will enable Blockchain Floripa to:</p><p><br></p><p>- Promote the event further online and in-person and incentivise community members to spread awareness of the event, leading to more attendees and more potential new EOS community members. As well as to pay for influencers to raise awareness about the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>- Make the event both more informative and more fun. With more funds to spend on better lighting, sound and entertainment, we can make sure that projects presenting on stage will be clearly seen and heard. If we are able to spend more money on entertainment, we can ensure the event is a great time for every attendee which will incentivise people to get more involved with the community and attend future events.</p><p><br></p><p>- Host more future events, bigger in size and bigger in ambition. With every event we want to level up the experience for those attending and therefore level up the size of the EOS community. Making Florianopolis both a crypto hub and EOS community hub in Brazil.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out our Instagram here - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blockchainfloripa/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/blockchainfloripa/</a></p><p><br></p><h3><strong><u>Floripa Crypto Day 2</u></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>14/12/22 Update - The event was an overwhelming success, we are collating the videos and articles written. See the first highlight video here - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFQov2j5mS/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFQov2j5mS/</a></p><p><br></p><p>We are raising funds now for the next event and to cover costs incurred on Floripa Crypto Day 2.</p>",

"title": "Artreus Store",
"summary": "Artreus is a decentralized exchange appstore for tokenized apps, games, game assets and app pluggins.",
"description": "<p>WHAT IS ARTREUS</p><p><br></p><p>Artreus aims to solve the lack of transparency and control in the traditional app/game market. In centralized appstores, app developers have limited control over the fees and revenue share agreements with appstore operators. Another problem Artreus tends to solve is lack of user control over apps or games, security and privacy. An Appstore built using the blockchain tends to be more secured as all transaction, app itself will be stored in a blockchain network. In centralized appstores, users&#39; personal data and app usage habits are often collected and shared with third parties without their consent, this often lead to data misuse. But on Artreus store, Users own their apps or game and the data in it, which they can resell for profit or share with friends.</p><p><br></p><p>One major feature that sets the Artreus store apart from every other store is the limited supply feature introducing the power of scarcity in apps and games industry. Traditional app marketplaces have been saturated with a seemingly infinite number of application, leading to a dilution of value. At Artreus store, we model after the bitcoin technology by introducing the idea of limiting the supply of apps listed. We restore the essence of rarity, breathing value to the app and game industry. Users who purchase apps on the Artreus store Own those apps, they would be part of the many others who bought into the value of a project. This can only be on Artreus.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Why Artreus store?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. Scarcity-driven Frenzy:</p><p>Imagine an appstore where each listed app possesses limited supply. This scarcity-driven model instantly transforms the value proposition of every application. Users become captivated by the allure of possessing an exclusive digital gem, fueling their desire to be among the select few who own it. This creates an ecosystem where rarity amplifies desirability, setting the stage for a new era of app discovery and appreciation.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Unleashing Developer Creativity:</p><p>For developers, our decentralized appstore offers a fertile ground for unrestricted creativity. By introducing limited supply, we ignite a spark of inspiration, challenging developers to craft apps that stand out from the crowd. With the fear of being lost in the sea of countless alternatives eliminated, developers can unleash their imaginations, pushing boundaries, and redefining what&#39;s possible in the app world.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Transparency and Trust:</p><p>Blockchain forms the backbone of our decentralized appstore, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Every transaction, every download, and every interaction is recorded on the distributed ledger, leaving no room for doubt or manipulation. Users can trust the authenticity of listed apps, knowing that each is a unique digital asset with limited availability. The era of counterfeit or unauthorized distribution is consigned to the past.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Enhanced Value and Appreciation:</p><p>By embracing limited supply, we restore value to the app marketplace. Each app becomes a coveted gem, a digital masterpiece that users cherish. The limited availability creates a sense of urgency, prompting users to seize the opportunity before it&#39;s gone. This elevation of value benefits both users and developers, fostering a thriving ecosystem that appreciates true innovation.</p><p>6. Security and privacy: The blockchain technology has enhance securing of digital assets. Its regarded as the most secured technology as at now. We have utilized this opportunity by improving the apps and games industry security by storing all apps, games and its data in the blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Artreus Store offers several public goods and benefits to users. Here are some of them:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Increased Accessibility: Artreus store allows developers from anywhere in the world to publish their apps or games without any central authority or gatekeeper. This enables greater accessibility to a wide range of applications, promoting diversity and innovation.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Censorship Resistance: Artreus stores operate on blockchain technology, which ensures a high level of censorship resistance. Apps cannot be arbitrarily removed or censored by any central authority, providing users with greater freedom of choice, expression and control.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Enhanced Security and Privacy: Tokenizing apps or games on a Artreus store can improve security and privacy. By leveraging blockchain&#39;s distributed ledger and cryptographic features, users can have greater control over their data and transactions. Additionally, the use of smart contracts can facilitate secure and transparent app interactions.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Transparent Governance: Many decentralized app stores utilize decentralized governance mechanisms. This means that users have a say in the decision-making processes, such as app listings, updates, and community guidelines. Transparent governance fosters trust, fairness, and accountability within the app store ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Incentivized Development: Tokenizing apps or games through the use of utility tokens or cryptocurrencies can incentivize developers to create high-quality applications. With our community driven dappstore, Developers earn directly from what is earned from their apps/games.</p><p><br></p><p>6. User-driven Economy: Tokenization enables the establishment of a user-driven economy within the Artreus store ecosystem. Users can buy, sell, and trade apps, games, or other digital assets. This peer-to-peer economy can foster entrepreneurship, reward user engagement, and create new economic opportunities for participants.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Reduced Monopolistic Power: Traditional centralized app stores are often controlled by a single entity, leading to a monopolistic environment. The Artreus store disrupts this concentration of power by providing a platform where multiple developers and users can participate on an equal footing. This promotes competition, prevents unfair practices, and encourages a healthy and diverse app ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Global Collaboration: The Artreus Store breaks down geographical barriers and facilitates global collaboration. Developers and users from different parts of the world can connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on innovative projects. This collaborative environment can lead to the </p><p>creation of unique and culturally diverse applications.</p><p><br></p><p>9. Easily Accessible: Imagine a place where all applications are not censored because of your geographical location or censored for selfish motives. A decentralized rulings of the internet, applications freely accessible by anyone and everyone. Everyone detecting how they want to see the internet</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In summary, Artreus store offers public goods such as increased accessibility, censorship resistance, enhanced security and privacy, transparent governance, incentivized development, user-driven economy, reduced monopolistic power, and global collaboration. Tokenizing apps or games within this ecosystem further benefits users by providing economic incentives, fostering innovation, and empowering individuals within the digital marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>Medium blog: https://medium.com/@officialartreus</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>our twitter page</p><p>https://twitter.com/OfficialArtreus</p><p><br></p><p>repo: https://github.com/Artreus-Organization(open source)</p><p><br></p><p>our demo video: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpmm99T1hgidGW57lGSEca2kwDsdk0k1N</p><p><br></p><p>Demo site</p><p>http://artreus.io our live page site(only on desktop view)</p><p><br></p><p>Pitch deck link:https://eu.docworkspace.com/d/sIOKKjrrdAd-1h6gG</p><p><br></p><p>Pitch video</p><p>https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuLRJC5Z8/ImfMcZKHBKyKCb6WdYnWmQ/watch?utm_content=DAFuLRJC5Z8&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink</p>",

There are many tutorials and documents on the market, but they are not very systematic and must be summarised and organized by themselves, and many concepts are difficult to understand, so we thought, why not create a comprehensive tutorial that is simple to understand? In addition to concepts, we have security knowledge, which is very important in the Web3 world, we also provide how to DYOR section, and we also provide a free mint NFT function, so the combination of theory and practice can help newbies enter the Web3 world faster.</p><p><br></p><p>We would like to apply for grants to add more information like NFT on EOS, and how to create your first NFT (from a technical perspective). We will continue optimizing and promoting this project, such as adding more languages, improving the interactive experience (especially the mobile version), and optimizing the content to make it more understandable, in the hopes of assisting more people who are interested in Web3.</p><p><br></p><p>We are also planning to make the second version of this project in the community. The topic is on our community forum <a href=\"https://forum.lxdao.io/t/the-next-version-of-myfirstnft/66\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forum.lxdao.io/t/the-next-version-of-myfirstnft/66</a>. In short, will add content for developers to build their first NFT project and improve the UI/UX to make it more structured and easy to track their progress. The grants will be really helpful for LXDAO to keep maintaining this public good!</p><p><br></p><p>For a brief introduction of the current version of MyFirstNFT, please check the video below:</p><p><br></p>[youtube]mLiqVgs93pw[/youtube]<p><br></p>",

"description": "<p>Meet <a href=\"https://github.com/bitshares/beet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beet</a>, a stand-alone key/identity manager and signing app originally built for Bitcoin and BitShares. Our goal is to develop this working proof of concept into a new, free and open-source web application for the EOS ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The problem Beet solves: Key management and trust on the EOS Blockchain</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Every action on a blockchain requires a cryptographic signature of the required private keys for this action. When using third party tools (especially closed source ones), the question about trust quickly arises. Particularly, <em>are they going to steal my private keys?</em></p><p><br></p><p>Beet aims to solve these trust concerns and streamline private key management for the everyday user. For example, Beet allows separate account management and full user control of what data is exposed to third parties.</p><p><br></p><p>Beet has additional features when compared to Metamask, since it runs as a desktop application and can take operation inputs as a JSON. This method saves developers time and adds flexibility across devices.</p><p><br></p><p>A more direct approach would be for the web app to communicate directly with Beet for signing and broadcasting transactions. This gives Beet an “Anchor-like” experience. This method eliminates the JSON step and lowers the chance of user error.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here&#39;s what we aim to offer the EOS Ecosystem through Beet: </strong></p><ul><li>Provide a free and open-source code base for the EOS community</li><li>Integrate and secure EOS/TLOS keys into the Beet wallet.</li><li>Refine the wallet User Experience (UX) for EOS</li></ul><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SgCFG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here&#39;s a proof of concept for Beet Wallet on BitShares.</a> (And here are <a href=\"https://s6.gifyu.com/images/S4A9e.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">some additional developments demonstrated</a>) </p><p><br></p><p>We aim to bring this working concept of Beet thus far into a stand-alone, free and open-source EOS Native wallet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We are members of the <a href=\"https://bitsharesgroup.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BitShares Group</a>, an independent organization acting in the best interests of the BitShares Blockchain. Beet has been an effort by many contributors that are a part of this organization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why do we need another wallet supporting EOS?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Infrastructure and diversity is critical for decentralized network security. Anchor and Wombat are excellent wallet utilities, and adding another capable wallet further strengthens the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, with Beet, EOS users and dApp developers would have an independent &#34;swiss army knife&#34; app to interact with the EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/bitshares/beet\" rel=\"nofollow\">peruse our Github</a> for additional information on what has been built so far.

With a strong focus on transparency and accessibility, Giveth provides open and free access to funding opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem. Through its DApp, Giveth ensures that 100% of all donations go directly to the intended projects, while donors to verified projects are rewarded with GIV tokens through the GIVbacks program. Giveth&#39;s long history and extensive network of experts in the space position it as a valuable contributor to the Web3 community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Goods Focus:</strong></p><p>Giveth&#39;s mission revolves around supporting and incentivizing the funding of public goods. By fostering a culture of giving and leveraging the Ethereum ecosystem, Giveth aims to create a regenerative economic system for nonprofits. To ensure the alignment with public goods, Giveth employs a rigorous verification process, requiring projects to submit applications for review by the verification team. Only projects that are deemed to genuinely provide public goods are eligible to participate in the GIVbacks program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Previous Achievements:</strong></p><p>Giveth boasts a track record of notable accomplishments that demonstrate its commitment to the Web3 ecosystem:</p><p><br></p><p>2016: Created the Minime token, used by every AragonDAO, Status and countless other projects, eventually it was forked and updated by Compound and now used by Uniswap, Gitcoin, ENS and many others. </p><p>2017: Launched our first and second versions of our Donation Application but ran into scaling issues (Cryptokitties)</p><p>2018: Organized the ScalingNow! Conference, bringing together the community focused on scaling Ethereum for the first time. Giveth made a bridge to Rinkeby to use as our own side chain, while also supporting the launch of xDAI.</p><p>2019: Spun out the Commons Stack to do applied DAO research, we created the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting.</p><p>2020: Started the work on the Token Engineering Commons, focused on advancing token engineering as a public good. This is our first step towards making nonprofits regenerative economic systems.</p><p>2021: Launched our fourth-generation donation platform and the GIVeconomy, which we are building on top of today.</p><p>2022: Launched GIVpower for decentralized curation of our platform and raised $1.2M for public goods-focused projects and gave out over $700k in donor rewards. </p><p><br></p><p>Here&#39;s a full description of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FvhJc-axIsHQsWDrrMJv4MsoiU4VNTA0hw9Wec_z1Qo/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">our historical highlights, success stories and 2023 updates of various Giveth projects</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Future Plans:</strong></p><p>Giveth has ambitious plans for 2023, subject to funding availability. The organization aims to solidify its position as the go-to platform for crypto donations by introducing additional features, including NFT integration, quadratic funding, and traceability mechanisms. Furthermore, Giveth envisions supporting successful projects on its platform in evolving into impact DAOs governed by soul-bound tokens, thus ensuring long-term sustainability and impact.

The first 3 elements have been developed (there is still room for improvement), but the last element - <strong>Workflow</strong>, is the one that remains for development, and then we will have complete automation-ready, not only the development and automation of new blockchain apps and processes but also the automation of existing blockchain apps and process as integration with third parties.</p><p><br></p><p>In a short, these are the key elements of the Blockchain Low-code App Development and Automation Platform:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(1) Dashboard - Intuitive Smart Contract Management</strong></p><p>Dev3 dashboard makes handling smart contracts a breeze.</p><ul><li>Easily handle EVM multi-chain deployments, smart contract versioning and get an auto-generated admin panel for every connected smart contract.</li><li>Enables non-developers to build web3 business logic and deploy smart contracts</li><li>Enables effortless automation of common Web3/Blockchain tasks</li><li>Deploy or connect any EVM deployed smart contract address, and Dev3 will decompile it into a human-readable interface!</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>(2) SDK &amp; API - Connecting Web2 with Web3</strong></p><p>Dev3 SDK &amp; API enable organizations to:</p><ul><li>Keep using their existing tech stack, tools and processes while simultaneously adding blockchain features to their products</li><li>Use traditional web, mobile &amp; backend developers to build Web3 applications</li><li>Write automation scripts for blockchain actions</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>(3) Execution Environment</strong></p><p>Ensure that all blockchain transactions and communications between your app &amp; end users are secure and effortless.</p><p>Developers building on Dev3 and users creating process automation can rely on our class-leading transaction execution UX! Simply by opening a web link, the user is transported into Dev3 Execution Environment! There, Dev3 will detect the smart contract and provide the user with a simple to understand description of what the transaction is about to do! All the user needs to do is wait for the callback API/SDK event!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(4) Workflows (<em>The support we need from you</em>)</strong></p><p>With the Workflows feature, EOS users will be able to automate blockchain actions and easily integrate third-party plugins.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the last, and perhaps the most important element of the Platform <strong>for which we ask for your support</strong>, which fully enables workflow automation and combining &#34;workflow items&#34; from many categories, such as:</p><ul><li>Wallet Authorizations - Authenticate users through cryptographic message signing with Web3 wallets or through custodial wallets</li><li>Deploy and Connect Smart Contracts and Execute Transactions - Add any number of contract deployments and transaction requests into a single, end-to-end business process</li><li>KYC &amp; AML Verification - Stay compliant by easily creating a user registration with KYC &amp; AML verification</li><li>Custodial Wallets - Initializing custodial wallets before entering a flow - ensuring anyone can participate</li><li>Fiat On-Ramp &amp; Off-Ramp - an integrated service that allows users to “Top-Up” their wallets with credit cards</li><li>Digital Signing - Enable your users to digitally sign legal documents as needed</li><li>Multisig - requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a crypto transaction.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>With Dev3 Workflows – you can quickly and easily create templates for any process involving blockchain interactions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>More on this is described below.</strong></p><h1><br></h1><h1>Introduction to Workflow</h1><p>A <strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a series of steps (<strong>blockchain read/write actions</strong>) defined by its JSON file.</p><p>A <strong>Workflow Instance</strong> is a concrete instance created out of a Workflow Template and has its own lifecycle.</p><h1><br></h1><h1>Workflow Template</h1><p>Series of steps describing one complex process.

It makes so much more sense for projects to make use of common tooling for their crowd sales. Blockchain entrepreneurs can then spend their time doing the things that really matter: building their community and building their product.</p><p> </p><p>T-Starter makes this common tooling needed for projects to raise funds and build on the EOSIO chain of their choice..</p><p> </p><p><strong>Public Good</strong></p><p> </p><p>At T-Starter we have developed all the tooling needed to deliver a working product. We have plans to further enhance this tooling and deliver new tooling which will benefit our own platform and EOS developers in general. To satisfy the public good requirement of the Pomelo grants we will open source our current code base. In addition, we will invest in completing documentation and test cases on our existing tooling and add new open source tooling that benefits our offering and the EOS community in general. Our current toolset includes;</p><p><br></p><ul><li>T-Starter user interface.</li><li>Pool sale, ballot, staking, EVM/EOSIO cross chain sale contract needed to support the core functionality.</li><li>EOSIO to EOSIO bridge contract and reporters allowing bridging of tokens between EOSIO blockchains.</li><li>EOSIO to EVM bridge contracts and reporters allowing EOSIO tokens to be bridged to and EVM based blockchain.</li><li>General escrow contract modelled off the functionality offered by Unicrypt.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Achievements</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Proven track record;</li><li>Serverless architecture;</li><li>Moved over $2M capital to projects;</li><li>Functioning crowdsale platform:</li><li>Self listing (anyone can list);</li><li>Community vetting;</li><li>Fixed price token sale pools with soft and hard caps.</li><li>Tooling available to projects:</li><li>Token vesting;</li><li>EOSIO bridge between EOS, Telos and WAX;</li><li>Token bridges to Ethereum, BSC and Telos EVM.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>What Next</strong></p><p> </p><p>T-Starter still has much to offer, and can be taken along many paths in the future.

With Forus, users consistently obtain funds through a fresh stealth address, preserving the utmost privacy in financial transactions Forus creates a fortified and confidential space, granting users the ability to receive funds discreetly through a quick , cheap and user-friendly interface.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Problem we are addressing here.</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>When using Forus, you no longer have to be confined to a single eosEvm wallet address. The issue with sticking to one address is that it can attract prying eyes. For instance, everyone knows that &#39;vitalik.eth&#39; belongs to Vitalik Buterin. This opens the door to tracking his transaction history and potentially gaining insights into his financial activities. This situation might not sit well with some individuals, right?</p><p>Here at Forus, you can bid farewell to the need for a personal wallet address. When you enter forus, simple generate a forus key (which is a cryptographic hash not related to any real blockchain address) make sure to securely store your forus key&#39;s private Key name as &#34;signature key&#34;. Once you have your Forus key, share it with the sender. The sender will then craft a new address for you by doing some fancy math with your forus key , one that neither you nor the sender could predict. From then you dont need to send him any real wallet address he got your forus key when u would transfer you funds a new stealth address would be created on demand which you can control only.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Here how it works?</strong></h2><p><br></p><ol><li>The receiver generates a new &#34;ForusKey,&#34; which is a one-time, base58 encoded address . Instead of sharing the personal wallet address, the receiver provides the Forus Key to receive funds.(Note : ForusKey is not bound to any blockchain address)</li><li>The receiver also generates a corresponding &#34;signature Key&#34; on demand, which serves as the private key for the Forus Key. This signature should securely saved for future use. (Note :Never share your signature Key with anyone always share ForusKey to receive funds)</li><li>Next the sender generates a stealth address by doing some fancy math stuff with the receiver&#39;s Forus Key and sends funds to this new address. Also sender generates a public key on demand, and publishes it in a designated logs directory. This entire process is completed in a single transaction.</li><li>The receiver periodically scans the logs directory and perform calculations using his signature Key and the sender&#39;s public key. Through Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the receiver derives the private key for the stealth address on which the funds have been sent.</li><li>With the derived private key, the receiver gains control over that address on which the funds have been sent and can manage the funds received securely.</li><li>In summary Forus uses cryptographic algorithms and one-time-use keys that allow users to receive funds through addresses which are created by sender but controlled by receiver.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>In summary Forus uses cryptographic algorithms and one-time-use keys that allow users to receive funds through addresses which are created by sender but controlled by receiver</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why do u need Forus ?</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>When people start poking into your transactions, they can act like detectives and piece together who you are and what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s definitely not cool, right? It&#39;s like someone snooping around in your personal diary. But that&#39;s where Forus comes in, making sure that your financial stuff remains private</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What next for Forus ? Milestones :</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Forus is still under development .There are important things we need to work on before it&#39;s fully functional and user-friendly. Here&#39;s what we have planned.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.Making it more User-Friendly</strong>: We want to make sure using Forus is easy and intuitive. We&#39;ll improve the design, simplify processes, and make it more user-friendly.</p><p><strong>2.Adding NFT</strong>s: Forus is now limited to coins and tokens only, but we have plans in integrating anonymous nfts transfers too , would expand its capabilities and attract a broader user base.</p><p><strong>3.Testing and Auditing</strong>: We&#39;ll conduct thorough testing and audits to find and fix any issues. This is important to make sure Forus is reliable, secure, and stable.</p><p><strong>4.Deploying on the Mainnet and on other evm compatible blockchains</strong> : We would make Forus accessible and compatible with all main blockchain networks .</p><p><strong>5.Relayer feature</strong>: The relayer feature would be added to securely withdraw the funds to the user&#39;s personal address without giving the gas fee in native currency . Because forus also supports erc20 tokens but its not possible to pay in tokens without relayers.</p><p><strong>6.Adding Cool Features</strong> : We&#39;ll keep adding new features based on what our users want. This could mean more privacy options, support for different tokens, or integration with other cool apps.</p><p><strong>7.Cross-Chain Compatibility</strong>: As interoperability becomes more prominent, Forus could explore enabling cross-chain transactions. This would allow users to maintain their privacy while transacting between different networks.</p><p><br></p><p>Our main goal with Forus is to make it easy to use while keeping your transactions private and secure. By working on these areas and making the necessary improvements, we hope Forus will become a trusted and widely used solution for private and secure transactions.</p>",

"description": "<p><strong>ABOUT HighFive</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Highfive is a personalized web3 domain customization platform that differs from ENS, Bit, Spaceid, etc. Highfive supports customized domain suffix systems from project parties, KOLs, etc. </strong></p><p><strong>Currently, several project parties and communities such as Mimic Black Cat and Suc Erjiu have already published their own domain systems on Highfive, such as Mimic&#39;s .mimic and Erjiu&#39;s .suc.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Why use HighFive? </strong></p><p><strong>Because domain names are not exclusive to top-tier projects, we know that ens has .eth and space has .bnb, which are both strongly associated with their respective projects. However, for ordinally projects, it seems very difficult to release their own domain names. HighFive solves this problem, allowing even a grassroots project to have its own domain name.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What are HighFive domain names used for? </strong></p><p><strong>They can be used to airdrop to core users or for user management. For example, we know that many project teams will ask people to leave their addresses on Twitter and then airdrop tokens, but how can they tell if the address belongs to a genuine user or just someone trying to take advantage of the situation? At this point, if the user has registered a domain name with the project name, say xxx.abc, then the user can simply leave the .abc domain name address and the airdrop can be done in batches. This is because those who are willing to pay to register the project&#39;s domain name must be core users of the project.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>On which chain is HighFive? </strong></p><p><strong>Currently, it is on the Ethereum main chain, and it about to migrate to TRUST EVM in the future.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Why can&#39;t I just issue a domain name myself and why do I need your service? </strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s simple. If you have enough technical skills and funding, then issuing a domain name on your own is not a problem. Our service targets projects that lack both technical skills and funding. In addition, for small to medium-sized projects, the number of domain name registrations is inevitably insufficient, possibly only a few hundred, and in such cases, it is almost impossible to get wallet support.</strong></p><p><strong>However, on HighFive, all domain names can be shared among users. With 500 registrations per domain name, 10 domain names would result in 5,000 registrations, and 100 domain names would result in 50,000 registrations. If there are 50,000 registrations, there would be 50,000 users, and any wallet would carefully consider whether to support it or not.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Relationship to EOS </strong></p><p><strong>HighFive </strong>will bring more new users to EOS and TRUST EVM, because it helps users of other chains to know and understand EOS and EVM, and to enjoy the unique advantages of EOS (industry-leading transaction speeds, high TPS and low transaction cost), and help EOS to expand its positive influence in the WEB3 world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How much do we need</strong></p><p>30,000 USD for promotion</p>",

"description": "<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>As EOS EVM was launched in April 2023, EOS is going to attract more Ethereum developers and end users to take advantage of the low fees, ulta-fast speeds, and reliability of the EOS Network. Solidity is used by the vast majority of web3 developers, and is supported by an extensive number of open-source code libraries, tools, resources, and tutorials. </p><p>But when coming to EOS developers still need an environment to test that it is fully compatible with EOS. Manually setting up a fully EOS environment is time consuming for newcomers.</p><p>Some applications need to communicate with both the EOS native and EVM layer for example token bridge, they can not rely on the existing web3 platform.</p><p>Because of that reason, we are creating docker utilities to set up a comprehensive environment of EOS EVM as well as utilities to help testing on that. Solidity developers can use that to test with EOS EVM without knowledge about EOS blockchain.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2><p><br></p><ol><li>Docker image</li></ol><p>We are going to dockerize everything that is needed to run the EOS EVM chain. We take advantage of DUNES docker image (<a href=\"https://github.com/AntelopeIO/DUNES\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/AntelopeIO/DUNES</a>) as a base layer of EOS native and then install more components of EOS EVM. </p><p><br></p><p>The docker image includes:</p><ul><li>Leap programs, CDT inherit from DUNES</li><li>EOS EVM smart contract</li><li>EOS EVM node, RPC, miner</li><li>Scripts to setup system</li></ul><p><br></p><ol><li>Command line interface</li></ol><p>CLI is not only used for development environments but also able to be used to communicate with any existing EOS EVM blockchain such as testnet and mainnet. The purpose of CLI are:</p><ul><li>Manage docker containers</li><li>Start, stop containers</li><li>Reset chain</li><li>Setup chain, system contract, active protocol features</li><li>Setup EVM smart contract</li><li>Setup EVM node, RPC, miner</li><li>Prefund accounts</li><li>Wrap up useful EOS commands:</li><li>Create account</li><li>Transfer token</li><li>Push action</li><li>…</li><li>Utilities to communicate between native and EVM</li><li>Transfer token to EVM back and forth</li><li>Register EVM miner</li><li>Encode, sign, push EVM transaction.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Resources and Timeline</strong></h2><p><br></p><h4><strong>Resources: 2 developers</strong></h4><h4><strong>Timeline: 4 weeks</strong></h4><p>Week 1: Build docker image</p><p>Week 2: Develop CLI using Nodejs and Commander package (<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander</a>). </p><p>Week 3: Test and fix bugs. Integrate with current web3 platforms such as hardhat, truffle.</p><p>Week 4: Update documents and feedback</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2><p>TruongTienBridge is a newly established team. Currently we have two main developers that have participated in several medium to large scale EOS and EVM projects. DUEE is the first project of the team, we are planning to create many other projects related to EOS EVM in the future.</p>",

"summary": "UNDRGRND will build an open-source marketplace to incorporate the existing publication highlighting emerging artists, through articles, exclusive drops to the community, and a physical gallery, and bring a new audience to EOS.",
"description": "<p>Artists now more than ever need the help of an outside source to validate and discover their work. UNDRGRND provides essential social media support through weekly publications and purchasing artwork to give financial support to artists as well. Many art NFT platforms offer a marketplace for artists to sell their work but little is done to support the collecting of said work. Now, with the winding down of another art marketplace that supported EOS minting, artists need a place to turn to migrate their work from custodial wallets to on-chain. Collectors and artists will turn to other supported chains with no clear art platform on EOS. UNDRGRND can be the landing spot for these displaced artists from Voice.com and begin to cultivate a culture of art appreciation on EOS Mainnet.</p><p><br></p><p>NFTs help preserve culture through immutability. UNDRGRND helps support those cultures with context, exposure, and financial contributions. EOS can become a part of the digital renaissance by helping build art-centric platforms like UNDRGRND. Funds from the grant will go towards building a marketplace dedicated to artists entering the space or relatively unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>UNDRGRND focuses on:</p><ul><li>curating lesser-known artists from culturally diverse backgrounds</li><li>writers to provide culturally relevant background on artists from Indonesia, Argentina, Germany, and more</li><li>educating a broader audience on how NFTs help preserve culture and the importance of art</li><li>utilizing its gallery to give these artists a real-world exhibition, crucial to expanding the artists&#39; impact and reach</li><li>an open platform where any artist can mint and receive free marketing via our publication, drops, and social media</li><li>creating a marketplace that codes artist royalties into the smart contract, preventing other platforms from not fulfilling the agreement</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Providing a marketplace for artists to sell their work with an integrated publication allows artists to tell the story of themselves and their art that would usually go unheard. UNDRGRND gives the artists the platform, resources, and opportunity to be heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Examples of artists telling their stories via UNDRGRND: <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-deniz-izadi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deniz Izadi</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-desh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Desh</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-mentalnoise\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mentalnoise</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-jordi-gandul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jordi Gandul</a> and <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/tag/%23UNDRGRND+ARTIST\" rel=\"nofollow\">more</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to early support, discovery and feature articles many of UNDRGRND&#39;s artists have gone on to find even greater successes on larger platforms to a broader audience, allowing for their stories to spread and be heard by the masses that would have otherwise gone unheard.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2><p>Founded in November 2021, UNDRGRND began publishing a weekly feature titled UNDRGRND DIGS. The premise was simple: highlight five deserving artists not appearing on large gated platforms that should be seen by a larger audience and buy their work. Over the course of two years, by providing context to the art, elevating the exposure of the artist, and purchasing their art, UNDRGRND helped over 300 artists grow their audience, reach new collectors, appear in a gallery of an established art brand, and bring in new collectors for financial support.</p><p><br></p><p>UNDRGRND also provides education for a new generation of art collectors. With no central hub for information, collectors and artists must crowd-source knowledge and experiences to learn the nature of the crypto art world. This sharp learning curve fractures audiences and creators, waiting to be discovered. Connecting the artist with collectors remains the key to success. Entire communities focus on this one aspect in the crypto social media sphere. These communities often lack resources and consist of artists collecting from other artists. This unsustainable model of artists supporting artists requires capital from outside sources. The UNDRGRND publication establishes a starting point for novice art collectors and much-needed support for artists with marketing and credibility.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/a8747b3b-3ee2-4643-8dac-ad855fd1bdb0.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The inception of cryptocurrency and crypto art was a response to the traditional ideals in the financial and art markets that for years remained gated and served an elite few. What was promised was a more democratic, community-driven market. What has transpired has been more of what was rejected in the old world. UNDRGRND focuses on empowering the community, incentivizing them to discover, recommend, and participate in helping curate. Many amateur collectors, or NFT consumers, balk at the idea of purchasing art due to the fear of &#34;not knowing art&#34;. Art is subjective and anyone can learn when given free access to information and context. UNDRGRND cultivates equitable opportunities with the belief that art if you can articulate why you like a work of art, then you can become an art collector. By removing stigmas, qualifications, and expert opinions many more feel empowered to collect art and support their favorite artists.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/af35b702-5e2f-4f46-ad30-049939d38df7.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>While many other art-centric platforms ask artists to apply and celebrate the top-performing artists, UNDRGRND will be an open platform, focused on highlighting yet-to-be-recognized artists. Through education, demystifying traditional art ideals, and providing access to effective, honest marketing, UNDRGRND can onboard a new audience of artists and collectors to the EOS ecosystem. Rallying the UNDRGRND community around an open marketplace, UNDRGRND can begin to expand its support of even more artists waiting to be discovered and become someone&#39;s new favorite artist.</p><p><br></p><p>Art and culture generate ideas that spark new life and growth. UNDRGRND can begin to lay the foundation for a new era of EOS.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f0f5fa06-78af-42e8-b9f4-380f117b1b6a.jpg\"></p>",

I would like to change this, to be specific, make about 10 ~ 20 videos about EOS, in one season.

And our videos can be reached and watched by anyone, without any limitations.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Why can we do it?</strong></h1><p>I used to get stuck on creating an EOS wallet. After some hard work, I solved the problem, but encountered another one: I could not find a way to transfer my tokens to others. CPU, NET, RAM, they are all new to me and it took a long time to fully enjoy the benefits of EOS.</p><p><br></p><p>All the hard word I have done, is what everyone else would encounter. I would like to share my experience, make videos about it, keep updating and replying comments in this season.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to raise about 10k USD, to fulfill the ambition; all the materials will be available across the Internet, for all users.</p><p><br></p><p>And all uses and readers are welcome to offer help and share their experiences, as part of the open community.</p>",

Additionally, we will implement various updates such as Plugins, a new distribution mechanism for protocol revenue, a deflationary mechanism, and spNFTs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/1d5231f0-409e-4f52-bcf3-10cd74a7e143.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/xneutro-token\" rel=\"nofollow\">1. xNEUTRO</a></h4><p>$xNEUTRO will be non-transferable and act as our governance token. $xNEUTRO main utility is the ability for it to be allocated by users to our various <a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins\" rel=\"nofollow\">plugins</a> such as:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/dividends\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dividends</a>: Giving $xNEUTRO holders a portion of revenue generated by Neutroswap</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/yield-multiplier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yield Multiplier</a>: Boosting users&#39; yield up to 2x</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/plugins/launchpad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launchpad</a>: Giving priority access to $xNEUTRO holders allocating to this plugin more exclusivity access to Neutroswap upcoming Launchpad</li></ul><h4><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/staked-positions-spnfts\" rel=\"nofollow\">2. Staked Positions NFT (spNFTs)</a></h4><p>The upcoming mechanism will replace the existing Neutro Farms as they both serve similar purposes. The key distinction is that instead of solely depositing LP tokens into the Farms smart contract, users will receive spNFTs in exchange for their deposited LP tokens, making it tradeable.</p><p>Users have the opportunity to mint staked positions NFT (spNFTs) by wrapping Neutroswap LP tokens, which involves depositing them into the respective contract.</p><p>This action transfers the deposit to a designated NFTPool contract, resulting in the issuance of spNFTs. Consider this NFT as a deposit receipt, confirming the ownership of the staked position.</p><p>The ownership of the spNFTs acts as the sole authorization for a user to withdraw the corresponding funds, irrespective of the entity utilizing them. Therefore, the owner of the spNFT is effectively the rightful owner of the associated LPs, even if they were not the initial depositor.</p><p>spNFTs go beyond being mere receipts; they serve as replacements for traditional yield-generating farms commonly found in DeFi protocols. Additionally, spNFTs provide an additional layer of features that unlock unlimited opportunities and potential extensions, offering a myriad of possibilities:</p><p><br></p><h4><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/staked-positions-spnfts/yield-farming\" rel=\"nofollow\">3. Yield Farming</a></h4><p>The primary objective of staked positions in the form of spNFTs is to replace conventional yield farming mechanisms and receive incentives provided by Neutroswap. However, these staked positions offer a versatile range of uses beyond this initial purpose.</p><ol><li>Yield-bearing NFTs: From a user&#39;s perspective, the mechanics of Neutroswap&#39;s spNFTs bear resemblances to regular DeFi farms. However, in contrast to allocating rewards solely to traditional farms, Neutroswap&#39;s Master contract distributes incentives to all staking positions associated with team-defined selected wrapped LPs. This approach ensures that incentives are widely distributed across the ecosystem.</li><li>Rewards: Neutroswap incentives are provided in the form of dual rewards, where eligible wrapped Neutroswap LPs enable their corresponding staked positions to receive both $NEUTRO and xNEUTRO rewards. The distribution ratio of these rewards varies for each asset, with the default allocation set to 80% $xNEUTRO / 20% $NEUTRO.</li><li>Yield multipliers: There are two methods to enhance returns from yield-generating staked positions: utilizing locks or the Yield Multiplier plugin. The specific values of these enhancements vary based on the staked asset, ranging from 0% to 150% (x1 to x2.5), although the default is typically set at 100% (x2). By summing these two multipliers, the total multiplier for the position is determined. Each pool will have its own maximum boost, with a default cap of 200% (x3) and an absolute cap of 250% (x3.5). These parameters are applied within the Neutroswap ecosystem.</li></ol><h4><a href=\"https://docs.neutroswap.io/neutroswap-v2-coming-soon/protocol-revenue\" rel=\"nofollow\">4.

Any surplus $NEUTRO obtained during this process will be automatically burned. Let&#39;s take an example to illustrate this process: If a user chooses to redeem 1000 $xNEUTRO with the minimum vesting duration of 15 days, they will receive a ratio of 1:0.5, resulting in 500 $NEUTRO. Consequently, a total of 1000 - 500 = 500 $NEUTRO will be burned throughout the redemption process.</li><li>xNEUTRO Deallocation: When users deallocate $xNEUTRO from a Plugin, a deallocation tax is imposed, typically set at 0.5%. This tax may vary across contracts. Furthermore, the corresponding amount of $NEUTRO will be automatically burned as a result of the deallocation process.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As we look to the future of Neutroswap and EOS EVM, we believe that a grant to bring liquidity to the platform is essential.

"summary": "UNDRGRND will build an open-source marketplace to incorporate the existing publication highlighting emerging artists, through articles, exclusive drops to the community, and a physical gallery, and bring a new audience to EOS.",
"description": "<p>Artists now more than ever need the help of an outside source to validate and discover their work. UNDRGRND provides essential social media support through weekly publications and purchasing artwork to give financial support to artists as well. Many art NFT platforms offer a marketplace for artists to sell their work but little is done to support the collecting of said work. Now, with the winding down of another art marketplace that supported EOS minting, artists need a place to turn to migrate their work from custodial wallets to on-chain. Collectors and artists will turn to other supported chains with no clear art platform on EOS. UNDRGRND can be the landing spot for these displaced artists from Voice.com and begin to cultivate a culture of art appreciation on EOS Mainnet.</p><p><br></p><p>NFTs help preserve culture through immutability. UNDRGRND helps support those cultures with context, exposure, and financial contributions. EOS can become a part of the digital renaissance by helping build art-centric platforms like UNDRGRND. Funds from the grant will go towards building a marketplace dedicated to artists entering the space or relatively unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>UNDRGRND focuses on:</p><ul><li>curating lesser-known artists from culturally diverse backgrounds</li><li>writers to provide culturally relevant background on artists from Indonesia, Argentina, Germany, and more</li><li>educating a broader audience on how NFTs help preserve culture and the importance of art</li><li>utilizing its gallery to give these artists a real-world exhibition, crucial to expanding the artists&#39; impact and reach</li><li>an open platform where any artist can mint and receive free marketing via our publication, drops, and social media</li><li>creating a marketplace that codes artist royalties into the smart contract, preventing other platforms from not fulfilling the agreement</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Providing a marketplace for artists to sell their work with an integrated publication allows artists to tell the story of themselves and their art that would usually go unheard. UNDRGRND gives the artists the platform, resources, and opportunity to be heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Examples of artists telling their stories via UNDRGRND: <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-deniz-izadi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deniz Izadi</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-desh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Desh</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-mentalnoise\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mentalnoise</a>, <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/undrgrnd-artist-jordi-gandul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jordi Gandul</a> and <a href=\"https://undrgrnd.io/undrgrnd/tag/%23UNDRGRND+ARTIST\" rel=\"nofollow\">more</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to early support, discovery and feature articles many of UNDRGRND&#39;s artists have gone on to find even greater successes on larger platforms to a broader audience, allowing for their stories to spread and be heard by the masses that would have otherwise gone unheard.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2><p>Founded in November 2021, UNDRGRND began publishing a weekly feature titled UNDRGRND DIGS. The premise was simple: highlight five deserving artists not appearing on large gated platforms that should be seen by a larger audience and buy their work. Over the course of two years, by providing context to the art, elevating the exposure of the artist, and purchasing their art, UNDRGRND helped over 300 artists grow their audience, reach new collectors, appear in a gallery of an established art brand, and bring in new collectors for financial support.</p><p><br></p><p>UNDRGRND also provides education for a new generation of art collectors. With no central hub for information, collectors and artists must crowd-source knowledge and experiences to learn the nature of the crypto art world. This sharp learning curve fractures audiences and creators, waiting to be discovered. Connecting the artist with collectors remains the key to success. Entire communities focus on this one aspect in the crypto social media sphere. These communities often lack resources and consist of artists collecting from other artists. This unsustainable model of artists supporting artists requires capital from outside sources. The UNDRGRND publication establishes a starting point for novice art collectors and much-needed support for artists with marketing and credibility.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/a8747b3b-3ee2-4643-8dac-ad855fd1bdb0.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The inception of cryptocurrency and crypto art was a response to the traditional ideals in the financial and art markets that for years remained gated and served an elite few. What was promised was a more democratic, community-driven market. What has transpired has been more of what was rejected in the old world. UNDRGRND focuses on empowering the community, incentivizing them to discover, recommend, and participate in helping curate. Many amateur collectors, or NFT consumers, balk at the idea of purchasing art due to the fear of &#34;not knowing art&#34;. Art is subjective and anyone can learn when given free access to information and context. UNDRGRND cultivates equitable opportunities with the belief that art if you can articulate why you like a work of art, then you can become an art collector. By removing stigmas, qualifications, and expert opinions many more feel empowered to collect art and support their favorite artists.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/af35b702-5e2f-4f46-ad30-049939d38df7.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>While many other art-centric platforms ask artists to apply and celebrate the top-performing artists, UNDRGRND will be an open platform, focused on highlighting yet-to-be-recognized artists. Through education, demystifying traditional art ideals, and providing access to effective, honest marketing, UNDRGRND can onboard a new audience of artists and collectors to the EOS ecosystem. Rallying the UNDRGRND community around an open marketplace, UNDRGRND can begin to expand its support of even more artists waiting to be discovered and become someone&#39;s new favorite artist.</p><p><br></p><p>Art and culture generate ideas that spark new life and growth. UNDRGRND can begin to lay the foundation for a new era of EOS.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.eosnation.io/pomelo/project_images/f0f5fa06-78af-42e8-b9f4-380f117b1b6a.jpg\"></p>",
